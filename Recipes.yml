    ingredients:
      - 1 1/2 oz brandy or bourbon
      - 3/4 ounce fresh lemon juice
      - 1/4 ounce Hunt + Alpine Cardamom-Coriander Syrup (see Editor's Note)
      - 1/2 ounce ginger syrup (see Editor's Note)
    steps:
      - Preheat a glass mug by filling it with hot water. Leave the water in for now and set it aside.
      - To prepare the drink, you'll want a heat-conducting vessel that fits into a second container. Two metal mixing tins work great. Fill the first with enough hot water that the second container floats in the water when placed inside the first. Essentially, you are creating a small bain-marie to preheat the ingredients without diluting them.
      - Add the brandy or bourbon, lemon juice, cardamom-coriander syrup, and ginger syrup to your mixing tins and stir gently until heated through.
      - Empty the water from the preheated mug and immediately fill it with the heated cocktail.
      - Top with 3 ounces of hot water. Express the orange twist over the drink, and place the cinnamon stick into the drink.

  - name: Cardamom-Coriander Syrup
    ingredients:
      - 2 cinnamon sticks, broken up
      - 1 1/2 teaspoons coriander seeds
      - 1 tablespoon black cardamom pods
      - 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
      - 4 ounces high-proof rum
      - 15 ounces hot water
      - 3/4 cup fine granulated sugar
    steps:
      - Preheat the oven to 450°F. 
      - Spread the cinnamon sticks, coriander seeds, and cardamom on a rimmed baking sheet and toast in the oven, tossing occasionally to prevent burning, until fragrant but not burned, about 8 minutes.
      - Combine the toasted spices, red pepper flakes, and rum in a blender, and blend on high speed until evenly ground, about 2 minutes.
      - Meanwhile, in a separate container, combine the hot water and sugar, and stir until the sugar is completely dissolved.
      - Set aside.
      - Using a coffee filter or multiple layers of cheesecloth, strain the spice and rum mixture into the sugar syrup.
      - Stir to combine.
      - Transfer to a clean, sealable bottle or container.
      - This syrup will keep, refrigerated, for 2 months.
      - Shake thoroughly before using.
      - As a substitute for the cardamom-coriander syrup, Volk recommends using 1/4 ounce St. Elizabeth Allspice Dram and 1 teaspoon of rich simple syrup (2:1, sugar:water).

    notes: For this nonalcoholic highball, I wanted to make a savory-yet-fruity cordial that used tea as a way to balance the sugar and let its tannic, bitter qualities create balance. Fresh bay leaves taste and smell just like Lipton iced tea, so it naturally plays really well with the black tea. -TB
    ingredients:
      - 2 ounces cold seltzer
      - 4 ounces Alpenglow Cordial
      - ½ ounce fresh lime juice
      - Garnish: 1 fresh bay leaf
    steps:
      - Pour the seltzer into a Collins glass. Short shake the remaining ingredients with ice for about 5 seconds, then strain into the glass. Fill the glass with ice cubes and garnish with the bay leaf.

    notes: I get a lot of inspiration from culinary sources. There’s a recipe in the Alinea cookbook made with corn, coconut, and cayenne, so I wanted to make a highball around those flavors. Mezcal Vago Elote is a triple-distilled mezcal macerated with corn, so it tastes a bit like cooked corn. -MB
    ingredients:
      - 1 ounce Compass Box Great King Street Glasgow Blend scotch
      - 1 ounce Mezcal Vago Elote
      - 1 teaspoon Cane Sugar Syrup
      - ½ teaspoon lactart
      - ½ dash Bitter End Moroccan bitters
      - 4 ounces Harmless Harvest coconut water
      - Garnish: 1 grapefruit twist
    steps:
      - Chill all the ingredients. Combine them in a carbonating bottle, charge with CO2, and gently shake to help dissolve the CO2 into the liquid. Refrigerate the carbonating bottle for at least 20 minutes, and preferably for 12 hours, before opening. Pour into a fizz glass and fill with ice cubes. Express the grapefruit twist over the drink, then place it into the drink.

    notes: The goal with this drink was to create something that felt sophisticated and really focused on French ingredients. It’s got loads of apple and grape flavors, and the small dash of celery bitters helps ground all of that fruit and complements the bitter Suze. -TB
    ingredients: 
     - 2 ounces dry sparkling wine
     - 1½ ounces Domaine du Manoir de Montreuil calvados
     - ¾ ounce fresh lemon juice
     - ½ ounce Jean-Luc Pasquet Pineau des Charentes
     - ½ ounce Suze
     - ½ ounce Cane Sugar Syrup
     - 1 dash Bitter Truth celery bitters
    steps:
     - Pour the sparkling wine into a chilled flute. Shake the remaining ingredients with ice, then double strain into the flute. No garnish.

    notes: I created this drink when working on my first Death & Co. menu. We were down to the wire and needed a sparkling wine drink. Rose water and champagne is a classic flavor combination. Many drinks take a lot of tweaking to get them to the point where they work; this spec was my first pass, and it was approved right off the bat. That was a huge confidence-building moment for me. -MB
    ingredients:
     - 2 ounces dry sparkling wine
     - 1 cucumber slice
     - 1 ¼ ounces Campo de Encanto Acholado pisco
     - ¼ ounce Clear Creek Williams pear brandy
     - ¾ ounce Grapefruit Cordial
     - ½ ounce fresh lemon juice
     - 3 drops rose water
    steps:
      - Pour the sparkling wine into a chilled flute. In a shaker, gently muddle the cucumber. Add the remaining ingredients and shake with ice, then double strain into the flute. No garnish.

    notes: This is based on a classic spritz called the Bicicletta. Fennel and citrus is a well-trod culinary combination executed in cocktail form, and the fennel-flavored liqueur from the Don Ciccio guys is a fun flavor to play around with in drinks. -MB
    ingredients:
     - 1 ounce cold seltzer
     - 2 ounces dry sparkling wine
     - 1 ¼ ounces St. George Bruto Americano
     - ½ ounce Don Ciccio & Figli Finocchietto fennel liqueur
     - 1 teaspoon Giffard crème de pamplemousse rose
     - Garnish: 1 grapefruit half wheel
    steps:
      - Pour the seltzer into a chilled wine glass filled with ice cubes. Add the remaining ingredients and stir briefly to combine. Garnish with the grapefruit half wheel.

    notes: When developing cocktails, I usually start with one or two flavors and expand from there. In this case, I was excited about the interaction of three: Pineau des Charentes, whiskey, and amaro. -AH

     - 2 ounces cold seltzer
     - 1 ounce Cucumber Magnesium Syrup
     - 1 ounce J. Navarre Vieux Pineau des Charentes
     - ¾ ounce Tyrconnell single-malt Irish whiskey
     - ¼ ounce Amaro Montenegro
     - ½ teaspoon Chareau aloe liqueur
     - Garnish: 1 cucumber slice

    notes: I created this wintry spritz for a winter menu, swapping a darling amaro for Aperol, and augmenting the drink with bourbon. If you don’t want to carbonate this drink you can also stir it and strain over the sparkling wine. -ST

     - ¼ ounce Giffard crème de mûre

    notes: I pulled this shandy-style drink out of my ass, more or less, and it worked on the first try. It’s named after a Fugazi song, but I guess that’s not very straight-edge of me to name a drink after their work. -MB
    ingredients:
     - 1½ ounces Westbrook Gose beer
     - 1 ounce Beefeater gin
     - ½ ounce Krogstad aquavit

    notes: I made this drink for Death & Co. Denver’s first menu, and after working through a number of boozy, complex drinks, I needed something light and crushable. Even though cucumber is far from a new cocktail ingredient, it pairs perfectly with young spirits and screams “summertime.” -TB
    ingredients:
     - 1½ ounces Street Pumas Blended scotch
     - ¾ ounce Cucumber Magnesium Syrup
     - 4 ounces cold seltzer

    notes: This drink was on one of our first “luxury” menu sections, in which most of the drinks are big, spirituous cocktails that showcase aged spirits. Here, I wanted something that shows off the absurdly delicious Cyril Zangs 00 apple cider eau-de-vie. The rhum agricole lifts up the grassy aromas, and the whole thing tastes like biting into a Granny Smith apple on steroids. -TB
    ingredients:
     - 2 ounces cold seltzer
     - 1½ ounces Cyril Zangs 00 apple cider eau-de-vie
     - ½ ounce La Favorite rhum agricole blanc
     - ¾ ounce fresh lime juice
     - ½ ounce Cane Sugar Syrup
     - 2 dashes absinthe
     - 1 dash Malic Acid Solution
     - 1 egg white

    notes: Reisetbauer eau-de-vie, while pricey, are so expressive and unique that getting to play with them is such a treat. It’s the most elegant version of a Nuts & Berries (a 1980s cocktail made with Frangelico and Chambord) I could think of. -TB
    ingredients:
     - 2 ounces dry sparkling wine
     - 1 ounce Paul Beau VS cognac

     - ¾ ounce Strawberry Syrup
     - ½ ounce fresh lemon juice

    notes: Copenhagen-based Empirical Spirits makes this really cool vapor-distilled spirit which has the intensely floral flavor of habanero chiles but none of the heat. It reminded me of guava, so I took the recipe for a classic Mexican Firing Squad and swapped in the habanero spirit for tequila, and guava syrup for grenadine. There’s a tradition in tiki drinks for naming them after doctors; this one is a nod to a G.I. Joe villain. -MB
    ingredients:
     - 1 ounce Tapiatio 110-proof tequila
     - ½ ounce Tapatio Blanco tequila
     - ½ ounce Empirical Spirits Habanero Spirit
     - ¾ ounce fresh lime juice
     - ¾ ounce Guava Syrup
     - 2 dashes Angostura bitters
     - Garnish: 1 lime wheel
    steps:
      - Short shake all the ingredients with ice for about 5 seconds, then strain into a Collins glass filled with cracked ice. Garnish with the lime wheel.

    notes: When I started working at Death & Co., we had few truly low-ABV cocktails. I created this one around the pairing of pear and celery, which is a fresh take on apples and celery, a flavor combo we riff on frequently at the bar. -SJ

    notes: Everyone at Death & Co. loves Clear Creek pear eau-de-vie, but it's extra special to me. The first time I injured myself at work (I sliced my finger on a vegetable peeler), I was nursing my wound in the back, and Alex Day brought me a glass of Clear Creek eau-de-vie to cheer me up. That’s when I fell in love with the product. I based this low-ABV drink on the combination of pear and fennel; the rest of the ingredients fell into place to make a beautiful highball. -AH

    notes: This play on the classic Bizzy Izzy Highball showcases Siembra Valles tequila, which is a throwback to the style of tequila that was made before the industry was modernized. Its complex flavor profile is more akin to mezcal than the tequilas we drink today, so I added Lillet rosé and fino sherry to add balance and lightness. -AG

    notes: For his end-of-shift drink, our doorman Josh would always ask for a “gin spritz,” which is not really a thing. He basically wanted a gin of soda, as a way to taste through all of the gins on our back bar. So I wanted to create a cocktail for our “gatekeeper” that was actually a spritz. You don’t have to carbonate this drink; instead, stir the drink and strain it over the sparkling wine. -ST

    notes: Spritzes usually get locked into a box of bitter, fruity, and bubbly, so Jon and I wanted to show a different side of the Spritz. We also really wanted to get Riesling into a cocktail, so we amplified the subtle dill flavors in Riesling with Svöl aquavit, which is very dill-driven, and then we layered on the malic-acid characteristic of the Leopold sour apple. -AJ
    ingredients:
     - 1 ounce dry sparkling wine
     - 1 ounce Spring44 vodka
     - ½ ounce Svöl Swedish Style Aquavit
     - ½ ounce Leopold Bros. New York sour apple liqueur

     - ½ ounce fresh lemon juice
     - Garnish: 1 lemon wheel and 1 apple fan

    notes: Forthave is an intensely bitter amaro that tastes like rhubarb and eucalyptus. I based this wintry spritz  on a drink that Al Sotack created called the Poison Ivy, so I named it after another female comic book villain. -MB
    ingredients:
     - 1½ ounces Fever Tree tonic
     - 1½ ounces Bonal Gentiane-Quina
     - 1 ounce Domaine du Manoir de Montreuil calvados

     - ¼ ounce Honey Syrup
     - 1 teaspoon acid phosphate
     - Garnish: 1 mint bouquet and 1 lemon wheel

    notes: The addition of shiso and pear-flavored spirits makes this more interesting than the standard Japanese highball. If you don’t want to carbonate this in a whipper, you can freeze a batch of everything but the seltzer, then top it off with seltzer to serve. -MB
    ingredients:
     - 4 ½ ounces cold seltzer
     - 1½ ounces Suntory Toki Japanese Whisky
     - ½ ounce Glasshouse shiso brandy
     - ¼ ounce Mathilde Poire pear liqueur
     - 1 teaspoon Clear Creek Williams pear brandy
     - ¼ ounce simple syrup
     - ½ teaspoon Malic Acid solution
     - Garnish: 1 shiso leaf
    steps:
      - Chill all the ingredients. Combine them in a carbonating bottle, charge with CO2, and gently shake to help dissolve the CO2 into the liquid. Refirgerate the carbonating bottle for at least 20 minutes, and preferably for 12 hours, before opening. Pour into a Collins glass and fill the glass with ice cubes. Garnish with the shiso leaf.

    notes: This is an elevated gin and tonic riff that includes the grapefruit and maraschino duo from a Hemingway Daiquiri, with some Douglas Fir eau-de-vie for pineyness. At the bar we carbonated and bottled each serving of the drink, which was such a pain in the ass to do. The juice wasn’t worth the squeeze, as they say, so it makes more sense to build it in a Collins glass. -JA

    notes: This is a riff on an Old Cuban. While most Old Cubans are made with dark rum, I tried it with younger and younger rums before settling on a white rum, which led to a comparatively more simple drink, but definitely a crowd-pleaser. I wish more people would treat crème de menthe like absinthe and use it in tiny amounts as an accent. -JA

    notes: I learned to appreciate the simplicity of highballs when I worked at an izakaya, so I wanted to create a drink in that style. The name actually came to me first: "Shoganai" is Japanese slang that doesn't have an English equivalent, but is a way of saying "it can't be helped" or "I'm throwing in the towel." Ironically, the drink took a lot of collaboration to create. Making a highball with champagne instead of soda is complicated, as the wine adds a lot of flavor. The cider was a curveball, too; it was added after Tyson asked "What about Japanese whisky, champagne, and apples?" -DA

    notes: Tyson likes to name cocktails after Westerns, so this cocktail pokes fun at that (Silverheels was the last name of the actor who played Tonto). This is a beer cocktail made with ingredients I love, with the pineapple and crushed ice adding a tiki element. -JF

     - 2 ounces dry apple cider 
     - 1 ounce High West Silver oat whiskey
     - 1 ounce Clear Creek 2-year apple brandy

    notes: Another one in our ongoing series of tiki drinks named after "doctors." Amrut is a very tasty, very strong whisky from India that has tropical fruit notes. Other than that, it's similar to a Doctor Funk, a 1953 Don the Beachcomber classic. -MB
    ingredients:
     - 1 ounce Amrut cask-strength single-malt Indian whisky
     - ½ ounce El Dorado 15-year Demerara rum 
     - ½ ounce Batavia arrack
     - ¾ ounce fresh lime juice 
     - ¾ ounce House Grenadine
     - 6 dashes absinthe
     - Garnish: 1 orchid flower
    steps:
      - Short shake all the ingredients with ice for about 5 seconds, then strain into a Collins glass. Fill the glass with crushed ice and garnish with the orchid.

    notes: This no-ABV, Daiquiri-style cocktail uses Seedlip Spice 94 as its base. I like the Seedlip line of nonalcoholic spirits a lot, but they don't have much texture, so I added a good amount of pineapple juice to beef it up. -AG

     - 1½ ounces Seedlip Spice 94

    notes: This was my first Death & Co. spec, and the one I'm most proud of. It's based on the Infante, a classic tequila drink that's basically a tequila Daiquiri with orgeat as the sweetener. In this variation I split the base between brandy and rum to bring an autumnal flavor profile to an otherwise summery cocktail. (You can also use Cobrafire eau-de-vie de raisin in place of the Armagnac.) -DA
    ingredients:
     - 1 ounce Domaine d'Espérance blanche Armagnac
     - ¾ ounce Rhum JM Blanc
     - ¼ ounce Avuá Amburana cachaça 
     - 1 ounce fresh lime juice
     - ¾ ounce House Orgeat

Celery is one of my favorite savory elements to use in drinks; it's fresh and light, and can work with both savory and spicy flavors. -SP

    notes: This whiskey was the first bottling I had tasted from Barrell Craft Spirits, and I was blown away. They age this whiskey for more than a decade, then finish it in marcan barrels, which results in a novel flavor and aroma.

It sounds sweet, but it goes down easy. -JF

    notes: Yuzu have this intense acidity and an incredible salty-savory flavor, but they are also very aromatic and floral. Sometimes the creative process can be informed by trying to fill gaps, and Death & Co. hadn't put out many yuzu drinks. I tried to keep this "luxury" cocktail simple to honor the Nikka whisky, which has a nuttiness that's accented by the orgeat. The name is a reference to Navajo rug making and this idea that the weavers purposefully mess up one little corner of their beautiful, complicated rugs, because a perfect thing is not a living thing. To me, every drink is imperfect, which means we can always revisit and rethink our work. -SJ

    notes: I put this drink up to Matt Belanger, and he said, “Oh, this has all the Shannon things.” One of those “things” is the combination of scotch and Wray & Nephew rum, which I wanted to work into a whiskey sour variation. I also wanted to incorporate strawberries and olive oil, so a touch of soy lecithin keeps the oil in suspension. If you don't have any soy lecithin, add an egg white to the drink and dry shake it first. -ST

    notes: A common way for me to come up with a cocktail is to taste a base spirit first, identify a few flavors, then try to bring them out with other ingredients. I taste a lot of apricot in the Singani, so I amplified that with the apricot eau-de-vie, then completed the stone-fruit flavor profile with the oxidative nuttiness of the Sauternes and the macadamia nut syrup. -SJ

    notes: This is my take on a more bitter and complex sherry cobbler. A tiny amount of Zangs 00 cider eau-de-vie works wonders and makes the drink taste like my mom's apple crisp. The garnish is lavish, but a reminder that cobblers should be exciting and a little over the top. -DA
    ingredients:
     - 1 lemon coin (a quarter-size piece of rind with some flesh attached)

Strain into a julep tin and fill the tin with crushed ice.

    notes: Here, I'm trying to make a Toronto with Mexican ingredients. Vallet, Mexican fernet, is very dry and astringent, like trying to eat a teaspoon of ground cinnamon. I combine our macadamia nut syrup with macadamia liqueur; this is something I do frequently, as the syrup doesn't have much aroma, so when used in tandem they complete the circle of macadamia nut. -SJ

    notes: This is the whiskey and aged-rum drinker's pinnacle, full of base tone flavors. Even though there's more whiskey in the build, the drink is really more about the rum, which is so intense you don't need much of it. PX sherry adds extra texture and sweetness, and the rum just sucks that right up. -SJ

    notes: After Japanese whisky started to get really popular but before they clamped down on allocations, we'd buy every bottle of Yamazaki that we could get our hands on. By the time this drink went on the menu, we were sitting on a massive stockpile of the stuff. This was the most expensive cocktail on the menu, but we sold the shit out of it. If you can't find Yamazaki, use Santori Toki or Nikka Coffey Grain in its place, and it will be almost as good. -MB

    notes: This was my favorite Death & Co. spec, and it pretty much wrote itself. Jon Armstrong created the habanero tincture as a way to add spice to drinks without having to use jalapeño-infused tequila. As for the peanut butter-infused rye - a lot of people taste peanuts in Old Overholt, so I amped that up with a fat-wash infusion, then augmented it with a smoky, chocolaty mezcal. Peanut butter loves honey, so honey syrup became the sweetener. We sold so many of this cocktail, because it contains a trifecta of ingredients that makes guests think "I have to have that." -JW

    notes: It's ironic that Old-Fashioned style cocktails are usually our most popular drinks, but often the last ones developed for a menu. Here, I started with a Toki Highball, Japan's most notable cocktail, and started deconstructing it. Toki whisky is a young blend with lots of pear, honey, and rose on the nose; Bertoux adds nuances of juicy stone fruit that intensify those flavors, while the Caol Ila pushes the Toki's subtle smoky notes. Our original intention was to add seltzer and make this into a highball, but we realized that the drink was better without bubbles. -JT

    notes: This drink was all about the corn-infused mezcal. By toasting dried corn husks and making a sous-vide infusion, the husks not only accentuate the roasted flavor of the agave but also add an almost mineral spiciness to the mezcal. Chichicapa tastes like chocolate-covered green chilies, so the crème de cacao was an obvious addition to complement the spirit. -TB

    notes: I recommend using a good champagne in this sparkling wine-based cobbler, so that the other ingredients can amplify its flavor profile. Orgeat does a lot of the lifting here and gives the drink richness, while the rose water is barely perceptible but brightens up the drink and plays well with the floral kirsch. -SJ
    ingredients:
     - 3 ounces dry sparkling wine
     - ¾ ounce Domaine d'Espérance blanche Armagnac
     - ¼ ounce Massenez Kirsch Vieux cherry brandy
     - ½ ounce House Orgeat
     - 3 drops rose water
     - Garnish: 1 grapefruit twist
    steps:
     - Pour the sparkling wine into a tulip glass. Add the remaining ingredients and fill the glass with crushed ice. Express the grapefruit twist over the drink and insert it into the ice. Serve with a straw.

    notes: I was inspired to make this by the Cazottes, which is somewhere between an aperitif and an eau-de-vie made with heirloom tomatoes. It has a really bizarre fresh tomato flavor and aroma of tomato vines. It's probably the most expensive ingredient we've ever put on a menu. So the rest of the drink is configured to showcase the Cazottes while spending as little money as possible. -MB
    ingredients:
     - 2½ ounces Dolin dry vermouth

    notes: This drink is similar to something my grandfather, who was from Modena, used to drink. I originally wanted to use white balsamic vinegar in this Manhattan variation, but Jonnie Long turned me on to aigre doux (sweet and sour), and I became obsessed with it. It adds this beguiling flavor that nobody can put their finger on. -CN

    notes: You could call this a carrot Negroni, with other earthy and vegetal flavors complementing the carrot eau-de-vie - artichoke from the Cynar and caraway from the aquavit. While the name evokes something divisive, the drink was more well received than I expected, and I still make it a lot when people ask for something bizarre but approachable. -ST

    notes: Menthe-pastille is usually something you stay away from in larger amounts, but its big menthol flavor works well with mezcal and tequila in this Martini variation. It's a playful drink named after a playful dance, and you'll be surprised how palatable it is. You can definitely make a batch of this and keep it in the freezer. -AH

    notes: This Vieux Carré variation is inspired by my favorite stirred drink, but I also think about it a lot in the context of a bar like Death & Co, where we've been criticized for using too many ingredients and overcomplicating things. But even the classic Vieux Carré is a seven-bottle pickup, so sometimes more is better. -AS

    notes: Amrut tastes like scotch that was made in the tropics, I guess because that's exactly what it is—you can somehow taste the heat of Southern India in the flavor profile.

    notes: I love a drink that's perfectly clear and served on a big rock, but it often doesn't work because those drinks die quickly on ice. White Negronis are the exception, but it's difficult to create a new White Negroni variation because there aren't a lot of clear bitter ingredients.

    notes: With our luxury cocktails, we get the opportunity to work with ingredients made with the highest intention—we don't use expensive ingredients just for the sake of it. Monkey 47 gin is made in Germany and contains a whopping 47 botanicals; you can drink it neat, and it's an experience in itself. A classic Martini showcases the bartender's understanding of ingredients, and hopefully this drink does as well. Because Monkey 47 has a lighter, more delicate flavor profile, a traditional dry vermouth would bully it, so I used a plum wine instead. A teaspoon of mango brandy works as seasoning to lift the other flavors, like playing harmony under a solo. -JF

It's essentially a mezcal Negroni inspired by Scott Teague's Straight Razor. It's meant to be a slow sipper; as it dilutes, the flavors open up, the drink loses some of its bitterness, and it tastes brighter and more summery. -CJ

    notes: This fall tiki drink came on the heels of reworking the gardenia mix, which is essentially a spiced honey-butter syrup. On your first sip, the cocktail tastes like apple butter, and it finishes dry and very tart, so it begs you to keep drinking, like a good Daiquiri. -SJ
    ingredients:
     - 1 ¼ ounces Domaine du Manoir de Montreuil Selection calvados
     - ½ ounce Rhum JM VO rhum agricole

     - Garnish: 1 apple fan and 1 cinnamon stick
    steps:
     - Short shake all the ingredients with ice for about 5 seconds, then strain into a pilsner glass. Fill the glass with crushed ice. Garnish with the apple fan, insert a cinnamon stick in the drink, and serve with a straw.

    notes: Developing this drink was such a pain in the ass. Originally, I wanted to make something that tasted like drinking a carrot cake. I love peanuts and sherry together, and I've worked a lot with peanut-infused sherry, so I tried pairing it with carrot eau de-vie, but I couldn't get it to work. This drink taught me that sometimes you have to let go of what you want a drink to be and just allow it to show you what it wants to be. So l swapped in cognac, but it was boring and flat. Tyson suggested adding a little aquavit, and suddenly-finally-it worked. -AJ

      notes: Alex has long been captivated by the combination of scotch and raisins, an obsession born from late-night snacks accompanied by big glasses of whiskey. Indeed, the concentrated fruitiness of raisins pairs perfectly with the lusciousness of a blended scotch like Famous Grouse. In addition to flavor, the madeira and Bénédictine bring a balanced amount of sweetness to the cocktail, making any extra sweetener unnecessary.

      notes: Amaro shows off its versatility when used as the core of an Old-Fashioned; it also provides seasoning and sweetness, so neither bitters nor sugar syrup is needed.

Make sure you include a bit of the lime flesh, as it will brighten the drink nicely.

      notes: Reimagining the core and balance of the Old-Fashioned can yield some interesting effects. The Stinger, a pre Prohibition drink of untraceable origin, classically consisted of just brandy and crème de menthe, the latter providing both seasoning and sweetening. For our version of this classic, we include a bit of simple syrup to boost the flavor of the crème de menthe and curtail the brandy's strength. Though it's traditionally served up, we like to dress up our Stinger like a Julep and serve it with two straws for two-person consumption, à la Lady and the Tramp.
      ingredients:
      - 2 ounces Pierre Ferrand Ambre Cognac 
      - ½ ounce white crème de menthe 
      - 1 teaspoon simple syrup

By contrast, the Improved Whiskey Cocktail, which was probably one. of the first popular Old-Fashioned variations, turns to absinthe for seasoning, which adds a deep complexity to the cocktail. The sweet red licorice and anise flavors from the Peychaud's bitters dial up the seasoning even more, while also increasing the impression of sweetness.
      ingredients:
      - 2 ounces Elijah Craig Small Batch bourbon

      notes: The split-base strategy that makes the Ned Ryerson successful can be used to generate a wide variety of drinks. We particularly love pulling back on the base and adding another spirit, like apple brandy, to accent the primary spirit. Together, rye and apple brandy are a magical, crowd-pleasing combination, and St-Germain makes everything it touches taste better. A dash of celery bitters adds just enough savoriness to pull the drink back from excessive sweetness.

This drink is based on the Golden Boy (page 10), and while it doesn't share any ingredients with that cocktail, it does take inspiration from its flavors: From the same starting point of raisins and whiskey, Devon took this cocktail to a smokier place by adding a touch of peaty Islay scotch to the core and balancing it out with raisin-infused honey syrup.
      ingredients:
      - 1¾ ounces Famous Grouse scotch 
      - ¼ ounce Laphroaig 10-year scotch
      - 1 teaspoon Raisin Honey Syrup
      - 2 dashes Angostura bitters
      - Garnish: 1 orange twist and 1 lemon twist
      steps:
      - Stir all the ingredients over ice, then strain into an Old-Fashioned glass over 1 large ice cube. Express the orange twist over the drink, then gently rub it around the rim of the glass and place it into the drink. Express the lemon twist over the drink, then place it into the drink.

      notes: In the Ned Ryerson, the core includes a small portion of young apple brandy, which adds a juicy flavor to the cocktail, and the Miracle Mile Castilian bitters in the seasoning are full of orange, licorice, and sarsaparilla notes. The result is an Old-Fashioned that's been reimagined with just modest changes.
      ingredients:
      - 1½ ounces Bulleit rye
      - ½ ounce Clear Creek 2-year apple brandy
      - 1 teaspoon Demerara Gum Syrup
      - 2 dashes Miracle Mile Castilian bitters

      notes: This is as rich and decadent as an Old-Fashioned gets, but there's not a drop of sugar syrup in it. Instead, the drink derives its sweetness from both a raisiny sherry and a vanilla liqueur, which provide a counterpunch to the nutty split base of Cognac and rum infused with sesame seeds. A dash of bitters is all that's required to zip these big flavors together.
      ingredients:
      - 1 ounce Pierre Ferrand 1840 Cognac
      - 1 ounce Sesame-Infused Rum (page 292)
      - ¼ ounce Lustau East India solera sherry
      - ¼ ounce Giffard Vanille de Madagascar
      - 1 dash Bitter Truth Jerry Thomas bitters
      - Garnish: 1 orange twist
      steps:
      - Stir all the ingredients over ice, then strain into an Old-Fashioned glass over 1 large ice cube. Express the orange twist over the drink, then gently rub it around the rim of the glass and place it into the drink.

      notes: The Conference, a groundbreaking Old-Fashioned variation developed by former Death & Co head bartender Brian Miller, has a core that's divided between four different brown spirits. The Autumn Old-Fashioned is a richer, deeper expression of that drink. We usually like to use maple syrup as a sweetener when we combine this many big flavors; it has a brightness that keeps the spirits from becoming too heavy.
      ingredients:
      - ½ ounce George Dickel rye
      - ½ ounce Laird's 100-proof straight apple brandy
      - ½ ounce Tariquet VSOP Bas-Armagnac
      - ½ ounce Bank Note scotch
      - 1 teaspoon dark, robust maple syrup
      - 2 dashes Bittermens Xocolatl mole bitters 
      - 1 dash Angostura bitters
      - Garnish: 1 orange twist and 1 lemon twist
      steps:
      - Stir all the ingredients over ice, then strain into an Old-Fashioned glass over 1 large ice cube. Express the orange twist over the drink, then gently rub it around the rim of the glass and place it into the drink. Express the lemon twist over the drink, then place it into the drink.

      notes: This crystal clear drink tastes like minty dark chocolate, earning its place among what we like to call "mindfuck drinks." Vodka is a nontraditional base spirit for an Old-Fashioned-style drink for sure, but infusing it with cocoa butter and adding a splash of chocolate liqueur gives it the richness and complexity of an aged spirit. With a drink this rich and sweet, a bit of savory seasoning, in this case Salt Solution, is needed to brighten the flavors.
      ingredients:
      - 2 ounces Cocoa Butter-Infused Absolut Elyx Vodka 
      - ¼ ounce Giffard white crème de cacao
      - 14 ounce Giffard Vanille de Madagascar

      notes: Developed for the inaugural Pacific Coast Highway-themed menu at the Walker Inn, the Beach Bonfire is designed to evoke the experience of sitting around a fire and taking alternating sips from a flask of whiskey and a cold beer. We start with our benchmark bourbon and add some cachaça for its chocolate and cinnamon notes, then sweeten the drink with pineapple syrup, which adds a nod to summer without making the drink taste tropical. At the bar, we'd hit the finished drink with a blast of hickory smoke before serving it next to a small glass of pilsner; at home you can skip the smoke and the beer if you like.
      ingredients:
      - 1½ ounces Elijah Craig Small Batch bourbon 
      - ½ ounce Avuá Amburana cachaça
      - 1 teaspoon Pineapple Gum Syrup
      - 1 dash Angostura bitters
      - 1 dash Bittermens Xocolatl mole bitters
      - Garnish: 1 dehydrated pineapple slice and a glass of pilsner
      steps:
      - Stir all the ingredients over ice, then strain into an Old-Fashioned glass over 1 large ice cube. Using a PolyScience Smoking Gun or something similar, shoot some hickory smoke over the drink to create just a whisper of smoke aroma (see page 274 for instructions). Garnish with the dehydrated pineapple and serve with the glass of beer alongside.

      notes: A Champagne Cocktail is essentially an Old-Fashioned in which Champagne stands in for the whiskey. Because of the lower alcohol content of the Champagne, partially diluting the drink as you would an Old-Fashioned doesn't make sense, and, of course, the bubbles in the Champagne wouldn't be well served by stirring. Therefore, this drink is built in a flute. Given that it isn't stirred over ice, like an Old-Fashioned, be sure to start with cold Champagne.
      ingredients:
      - 1 sugar cube
      - Angostura bitters
      - Dry Champagne 
      - Garnish: 1 lemon twist
      steps:
      - Place the sugar cube on a paper towel. Dash the bitters over the sugar cube until it's completely saturated. Drop the sugar cube into a chilled flute and slowly top with Champagne; don't stir. Express the lemon twist over the drink, then place it into the drink.

      notes: Riffing on a Champagne Cocktail can be as easy as riffing on any other Old-Fashioned variation. In this case, the sugar is swapped out for a sweet liqueur. Combier is an orange curaçao, and the "royal" bottling has a base of Cognac, which provides a rich backbone. In a way, this variation lies somewhere between a classic Champagne Cocktail and an Old-Fashioned, being made with Armagnac and Champagne instead of whiskey.
      ingredients:
      - 1 ounce Tariquet Classique VS Bas-Armagnac
      - ½ ounce Royal Combier
      - 2 dashes Angostura bitters 
      - 2 dashes Peychaud's bitters 
      - Dry Champagne
      - Garnish: 1 lemon twist
      steps:
      - Stir all the ingredients (except the Champagne) over ice, then strain into a chilled flute. Pour in the Champagne, and quickly dip the barspoon into the glass to gently mix the Champagne with the cocktail. Express the lemon twist over the drink, then place it into the drink.

      notes: Inspired by famed bartender Dave Kupchinsky's Lemonade cocktail at the Everleigh in West Hollywood, this drink also looks to the Champagne Cocktail for its simplicity and incorporates flavorful chamomile in an infusion of softly herbaceous and slightly bitter Cocchi Americano. It's exceedingly refreshing on a hot day.
      ingredients:
      - ½ ounce Chamomile-Infused Cocchi Americano
      - 1 teaspoon Suze

      notes: While the components of this cocktail other than the Champagne take up more volume than a sugar cube doused in bitters, they function in a similar way, enhancing the main spirit by amplifying flavors it already possesses: stone fruit, breadiness, nuttiness, and spice. Here we've added a new ingredient, Champagne acid, a combination of tartaric and lactic acid that enhances the tang of a dry Champagne.
      ingredients: 
      - ½ ounce Clear Creek pear brandy 
      - ¼ ounce Lustau Jarana fino sherry
      - 1 teaspoon Fortaleza reposado tequila

      notes: The combination of Cognac and Jamaican rum appears frequently in older cocktail recipes. Here, the duo creates a big, funky core flavor that plays off the bright fruit of the peach liqueur. The amaro acts as a bridge between these two opposing camps, working in much the same way bitters do, balancing other disparate flavors.

      notes: The baked stone fruit and warm autumn flavors of this cocktail make it a great option for an Old-Fashioned lover who's looking for something on the more refreshing side. We double down on pear, bringing the spirituous heat and pear-like gritty texture thanks to pear brandy and the supple fruitiness of the pear liqueur. The addition of Amaro Montenegro brings this drink into the aperitif category.

      author:

      notes: Truly great cocktails become iconic. A Sazerac is such a drink. When you look at the Sazerac's composition spirit, sugar, bitters, citrus-it's so obviously linked to the Old-Fashioned, yet there are differences: While both are served in an Old-Fashioned glass, the Old Fashioned is served on ice, whereas the Sazerac is served neat. The Old-Fashioned is garnished with twists of citrus in the glass, whereas the Sazerac has a lemon twist expressed over the glass, but the twist is then discarded. Most dramatically, the Sazerac plays a trick on the drinker's senses: Before the cocktail is poured, the glass is rinsed with absinthe, creating a pungent anise and citrus aroma that persists until the glass is empty-an aroma that contrasts with the cool, boozy liquid below. It's this technique-rinsing the glass with a highly aromatic spirit-that sets a Sazerac apart and defines it and the variations on it that follow. The Sazerac also provides a good example of how classic cocktails evolved based on regionally available ingredients. In the mid-1800s, the spirit of choice in Francophilic New Orleans-the Sazerac's birthplace was Cognac, but by the end of the century a shortage of French brandy due to a phylloxera outbreak that plagued France's vineyards shifted the Big Easy's focus to rye. New Orleans-made Peychaud's bitters, with its distinctive anise flavor, has remained a constant, but we've found that French absinthe and Angostura bitters are welcome additions to the benchmark recipe.
      ingredients: 
      - Vieux Pontarlier absinthe
      - 1½ ounces Rittenhouse rye
      - ½ ounce Pierre Ferrand 1840 Cognac
      - 1 teaspoon Demerara Gum Syrup

      notes: Although it's aged for eight years, the apple brandy in this drink doesn't taste much like an aged spirit, so we also include pot-distilled Irish whiskey, with its vanilla and spice flavors, in the core. And because Irish whiskey has a nice affinity for honey, we use a honey syrup for the sweetener, which keeps the drink light and crisp, whereas Demerara Gum Syrup would probably be too cloying.
      ingredients: 
      - Vieux Pontarlier absinthe
      - 1½ ounces Clear Creek 8-year apple brandy

      notes: In this cocktail, the tart bite of the cherry-infused rye whiskey is complemented by juiciness from the apple brandy, but alone those ingredients would come across as sweet and bland. However, just a couple of dashes of absinthe add an anise pop and complexity to the drink, accenting the tart and juicy flavors in an unexpected way-a great demonstration of the power of the seasoning.

      notes: The idea of putting bananas in a boozy cocktail once seemed questionable at best. Then the liqueur company Giffard introduced Banane du Brésil to the US market, a banana liqueur that far exceeded our expectations.

      notes: Replace the high-proof whiskey in an Old-Fashioned with a larger quantity of low-proof amontillado sherry, and swap muddled orange slices for the bitters, and you have a Cobbler. Amontillado sherry is a fortified wine that gives the cocktail both body and acidity, making it a strong backbone for the drink. When muddled, the orange wheels add not only a touch of sweetness from the flesh but also some seasoning from the bitter pith and the vibrant oils in the skin. This complexity is nicely counterbalanced by the levity and bright aroma of the fresh mint garnish. When it comes to the garnish, don't limit yourself to the orange wedge and mint called for here; an array of seasonal fruits is traditional, so play around with whatever fruits or herbs you have on hand. It's become an inside joke among our bartender friends to make the most ludicrous, overgarnished cobbler any time one of us requests one.
      ingredients: 
      - 3 orange slices 
      - 1 teaspoon Cane Sugar Syrup
      - 3 ½ ounces amontillado sherry 
      - Garnish: 1 orange half wheel and 1 mint bouquet

      notes: Almonds and stone fruits, such as apricots, peaches, and plums, are botanically related, and they tend to taste great together in cocktails. Amontillado sherry continues the nutty theme, while Cognac adds a bit of richness and proof. While fresh stone fruit can be a bit inconsistent in terms of sugar and acid, this template is nicely balanced to accommodate fruits of various ripeness.

      author: 
      year: 
      source: "Death & Co: Cocktail Codex"
      notes: Water is an often overlooked element of cocktails. In our Old-Fashioned, the water comes from a bit of dilution, both while stirring the ingredients over ice and as the chunk of ice in the cocktail melts a bit. A toddy, then, is really just an Old-Fashioned that swaps in hot water for cold. This takes the cocktail in a different direction for two key reasons. First, heat increases the perception of alcohol. If you were to take the same amount of water present in a properly diluted Old-Fashioned about 1 ounce-and warm it along with the spirit, sweetener, and bitters, you'd have a cocktail with an intensely alcoholic and unpleasant flavor. So for toddies the drink is lengthened. We've found that 4 ounces of water to 2 ounces of spirit is a good baseline. Second, alcohol evaporates when heated, so when you drink a hot toddy, the volatile aromas will rise to your nose before you take your first sip. This can be off-putting if the drink is too high in proof, but it also allows the drink maker to play with aromas, whether infused into a spirit or inherent in it. Calvados, for example, is ethereal when heated, with a warming perfume that's almost reminiscent of putting on a thick sweater. Because toddies are both heated and more diluted than other cocktails, they require a bit more sweetener and seasoning than Old-Fashioneds; otherwise, they feel thin. The small amount of lemon juice in the drink doesn't make it acidic; rather, it helps season the cocktail and bring the other components into harmony.
      ingredients: 
      - 2 lemon wedges
      - 1½ ounces Elijah Craig Small Batch bourbon
      - ¾ ounce Honey Syrup
      - 1 dash Angostura bitters

      - Squeeze the lemon wedges into a toddy mug, then add the remaining ingredients (except the water). Pour in the boiling water, then grate some nutmeg over the top of the drink and garnish with the lemon wedges.

      notes: If a traditional Hot Toddy isn't wintry enough for you, try this version, which was developed for the Rose, in chilly Jackson Hole, Wyoming. It evokes a boozy cup of coffee, with the Ristretto bringing dense espresso flavors to the mix, and cardamom-laced bitters offering savory flavors reminiscent of chicory.
      ingredients: 
      - 1½ ounces Pierre Ferrand 1840 Cognac
      - ¼ ounce Galliano Ristretto
      - ½ ounce dark, robust maple syrup
      - 1 dash Fee Brothers Cardamom bitters
      - 4 ounces boiling water 
      - Garnish: 1 cinnamon stick
      steps:
      - Combine all the ingredients (except the water) in a mixing glass and stir. Pour into a toddy mug, then pour in the boiling water. Garnish with the cinnamon stick.

      notes: A toddy is supposed to be soothing, and in this variation we've tried to add as many comforting elements as possible. Built on a backbone of Calvados and Pineau des Charentes (an aperitif made from unfermented grape juice and young Cognac), and enhanced with a restorative combination of chamomile, lemon, and honey, this toddy is rich and nurturing.
      ingredients: 
      - 1½ ounces Chamomile-Infused Calvados
      - 1 ounce Pineau des Charentes 
      - ½ ounce Honey Syrup
      - ¼ ounce fresh lemon juice
      - 4 ounces boiling water

      steps:
      - Combine all the ingredients (except the water) in a mixing glass and stir. Pour into a toddy mug, then pour in the boiling water. Garnish with the apple slices.

      notes: There's a lot more at play here than in a traditional toddy. The chile-infused bourbon adds gentle heat without making the drink overtly spicy, and bright apple juice stands in for water, adding an extra layer of complexity.
      ingredients: 
      - 1 ounce Thai Chile-Infused Bourbon
      - ½ ounce Luxardo Amaro Abano 
      - ½ ounce Alexander Jules amontillado sherry 
      - 3 ounces fresh Fuji apple juice
      - 2 ounce dark, robust maple syrup

      - 1 drop Salt Solution 
      - Garnish: 3 thin apple slices on a skewer
      steps:

      notes: Though we called out gin and vodka as the core of Martinis in the preceding section, we've also emphasized that the true core of these cocktails is a combination of spirit and aromatized wine. In the Vesper, the two core spirits are combined-something that works in this classic cocktail because of a corresponding shift in the balance, wherein the vermouth has been replaced with Lillet blanc. The Lillet has a similar alcohol content, but it adds a fruitier quality, as opposed to vermouth's savoriness, and its flavors are delicate enough that using just gin as the base-even a softer gin, like Plymouth-would overpower the drink. Replacing some of the gin with vodka helps to stretch out the gin's botanicals and allows the Lillet to shine.
      ingredients: 
      - 1½ ounces Plymouth gin 
      - ¾ ounce Aylesbury Duck vodka 
      - ½ ounce Lillet blanc 
      - Garnish: 1 lemon twist

      notes: Splitting the base with other spirits can be an easy way to keep the form of the Martini largely intact while creating an entirely new cocktail. The Dean Martin is a great example of this strategy, replacing some of the gin with a highly flavorful Douglas fir brandy. Because that changes the balance too, we added woodsy La Quintinye blanc vermouth to accent the Douglas fir eau-de-vie. The result is a cocktail that answers the question that inspired it: "What would a Martini consumed on a mountaintop in December taste like?"
      ingredients: 
      - 1 ounces Tanqueray gin
      - ¼ ounce Clear Creek Douglas fir brandy
      - ½ ounce La Quintinye Vermouth Royal blanc

      source: "Death & Co: Cocktail Codex"
      notes: This cocktail, in which fino sherry replaces the vermouth, offers a great example of how a fairly simple change to the balance calls for further adjustments. Because fino sherry is so dry, we've used more than the amount of vermouth called for in our root Vodka Martini recipe (page 62) and have also added a bit of honey syrup to give the cocktail greater body. Then, because sherry is a more delicate modifier than vermouth, in this cocktail we showcase the subtle texture of a wheat-based vodka—a quality that vermouth would overshadow. The final touch is a spritz of a mineral-rich sea salt solution, which gives the drink an added layer of briny aroma.
      ingredients: 
      - 2 ounces Aylesbury Duck vodka 
      - 1 ounce Alexander Jules fino sherry 
      - 1 teaspoon White Honey Syrup

      notes: A more sensational way to change the balance is to infuse the aromatized wine with flavorings. This drink is a riff on the Vesper (page 71), in which an aromatized wine (Cocchi Americano bianco) is flavored with a few drops of root beer extract. On its own, the infused Cocchi is tasty, but when mixed into the cocktail it gets a little lost, so we add a bit of orange marmalade, which introduces a touch of sweetness and a pleasant bitterness that bridges the flavors and helps highlight the infused Cocchi.
      ingredients: 
      - 1½ ounces Beefeater gin
      - ½ ounce Absolut Elyx vodka
      - 1 ounce Root Beer-Infused Cocchi Americano

    - name: Manhattan
      author: 
      year: A Manhattan is basically a Martini that uses rye whiskey rather than gin, and sweet vermouth rather than dry. The yang to the Martini's yin, it nicely demonstrates how altering one element of a cocktail generally calls for other adjustments. Aged spirits, especially higher-proof ones, need to be paired with modifiers that can support their intensity without being smothered. If we were to simply substitute rye whiskey for gin in a Martini, the rye would overshadow the vermouth. Classic Angostura bitters connect the peppery rye and sweet vermouth, and offer yet another avenue for exploration, as you'll see in some of the variations that follow.

      notes: In cocktail parlance, the term "perfect" refers to a drink that contains equal parts sweet and dry vermouth. Sounds easy enough, but splitting modifiers is tricky, especially in a Manhattan. If you use the wrong combination of vermouths, one (or both) will fight with the whiskey for attention. But in this recipe, the crispness of the dry vermouth, reinforced by the lemon twist garnish, results in a lighter, brighter Manhattan.
      ingredients: 
      - 2 ounces Rittenhouse rye
      - ½ ounce Cocchi Vermouth di Torino
      - ½ ounce Dolin dry vermouth

      notes: While gorgeous blood oranges are tempting to use in cocktails, the flavor of their juice is flabby and leaves something to be desired. However, blood orange zest is fragrant, with a bright, almost savory orange flavor; here it makes an appearance in an infused vermouth. The Cognac acts as a bridge in this Manhattan variation, linking the spiciness of the rye with the vermouth’s bitter notes.

      - 1½ ounces Blood Orange-Infused Carpano Antica Formula

      notes: True, the Martini and its variations typically involve a simple harmony of spirit and vermouth, but as just mentioned, a host of cocktails in its extended family also include a small amount of liqueur. In the Martinez, just 1 teaspoon of maraschino liqueur brings both fruitiness and astringency, qualities that pair beautifully with the vanilla flavors in aged spirits and sweet vermouth. When coming up with Martinez variations, the liqueur is a great place to start, given that there are so many interesting choices to explore, from Bénédictine, which introduces a honeyed sweetness and herbal undertones, to fruit liqueurs, such as peach, apricot, or raspberry.
      ingredients:

      notes: Here’s a complex, Martinez-style drink that uses a soft scotch and a rich, spicy contemporary gin in place of the traditional Old Tom gin. This is a great example of the value of knowing your ingredients: The unique sarsaparilla flavors of the Aviation gin marry well with the cola notes found in both the sweet Spanish vermouth and the Ramazzotti amaro; substituting another brand of any of these ingredients will yield markedly different results.

      year: 
      source: "Death & Co: Cocktail Codex"
      notes: Another strategy for experimenting with the balance is to substitute small amounts of amari or liqueurs for a portion of the vermouth or aromatized wine. The most classic example of this is the Brooklyn, a riff on the Manhattan that uses a bit of amaro and just a teaspoon of maraschino liqueur. Despite its Manhattan-adjacent name, you can quickly recognize this drink as a rye-based variation on the Martinez (page 86) because of the liqueur. Though the Brooklyn was historically made with Amer Picon, an orange flavored French liqueur, modern bottlings of Amer Picon-if you can even find them-are less bitter and flavorful than older versions, so in its place we use China-China Amer, a bittersweet aperitif crafted with the classic Amer Picon recipe in mind.
      ingredients: 
      - 2 ounces Rittenhouse rye
      - ¾ ounce Dolin dry vermouth

Don't have a centrifuge? No sweat: just lightly muddle a few watercress leaves with the vermouths and peach liqueur, then remove them and build the cocktail.

      notes: By and large, the cocktails in this chapter are characterized by a core flavor of spirit and vermouth or another aromatized wine, and generally speaking, they fail when those components aren't in balance. However, there is an exception to this rule (as there always is): the Negroni, a deeply bitter cocktail made with a full ounce of Campari. Because Campari brings a lot of proof to the drink, the Negroni has less gin, and it finds its balance in the typical core of gin and vermouth, but in an equal parts combination in which the amaro is a unified part of the core, with the gin providing a clean structure upon which the bitterness of Campari is balanced by the richness of the sweet vermouth. In the variations that follow, you'll find a few other cocktails that employ a similar tactic, substituting high-alcohol liqueurs or other amari for the Campari, and adjusting the balance of ingredients so they harmonize as a whole.
      ingredients: 
      - 1 ounce Tanqueray gin

Now that you understand the basic orthodoxy of the Martini (and, likewise, the Negroni), this shouldn't come as a surprise: although a perfectly delicious Boulevardier can be made with equal measures, using more bourbon and less Campari and vermouth promotes the whiskey's flavor just enough that it asserts itself.
      ingredients: 
      - 1½ ounces Elijah Craig Small Batch bourbon
      - ¾ ounce Carpano Antica Formula vermouth
      - ¾ ounce Campari
      - Garnish: 1 brandied cherry
      steps:
      - Stir all the ingredients over ice, then strain into a chilled coupe. Garnish with the cherry.

      notes: The Old Pal is almost identical to the Boulevardier, with dry vermouth being substituted for the sweet, and rye whiskey instead of bourbon. Though this Old Pal teeters toward sweet, it's also spicy thanks to the rye, with a bright backbone from the French vermouth, and a bitter finish via Campari.
      ingredients: 
      - 1½ ounces Rittenhouse rye

      notes: If there's one unifying theme among all the Martini variations in this chapter thus far, it's that they're very boozy. But here's an iteration that's lower in ABV while still reflecting the spirit of the Martini: the classic Bamboo, which swaps out gin for amontillado sherry. Because the sherry is lower in alcohol and not as pungently flavored as gin, the proportion of vermouth is increased to balance the cocktail-the vermouths surround the sherry and add sweetness and depth of flavor. The Bamboo is a very old drink, having originated in Japan in the late nineteenth century, but it remains one of our favorite cocktails today-so much so that we often serve it on tap at our bars.
      ingredients: 
      - 1½ ounces Lustau Los Arcos amontillado sherry
      - ¾ ounce Dolin blanc vermouth 
      - ¾ ounce Dolin dry vermouth

      - Garnish: 1 lemon twist
      steps:

      notes: What would it taste like to drink wine while standing in a Sonoma farm? To answer the question that inspired this riff on the Bamboo, we start with a fruity Chardonnay and add a touch of sweet honey; the bright grapey acidity of verjus; and Calvados, an apple brandy native to Normandy, France, another bucolic agricultural region. Topping it off is a spray of a white pepper aroma, which has the distinct smell of a barn.
      ingredients: 
      - 2½ ounces dry, unoaked Chardonnay
      - ½ ounce Busnel VSOP Calvados 
      - 1 teaspoon Fusion Napa Valley verjus blanc

      notes: A lighter, brighter riff on the Bamboo, this is our take on a root-to-stem cocktail that uses the entire Meyer lemon. We combine the ingredients and infuse the cocktail with the fruit's fragrant zest, then we use the leftover juice to make a Meyer lemon cordial that can be made into a carbonated soda and served alongside this cocktail. The recipe below makes about 1 liter—the perfect sophisticated and refreshing aperitif for a party. Serves 10.
      ingredients: 
      - 12 ounces Lustau Puerto fino sherry
      - 6 ounces Dolin blanc vermouth
      - 6 ounces Dolin dry vermouth 
      - 4 ounces Campo de Encanto Moscatel pisco
      - Zest from 2 Meyer lemons 
      - 1¼ ounces Cane Sugar Syrup
      - 8 dashes House Orange Bitters
      - 8 ounces water 
      - Garnish: 10 Meyer lemon wheels
      steps:
      - Combine half of the sherry, vermouths, pisco, and zest in an iSi whipper (see page 97). Following the pressure infusion method explained on page 97, infuse the mixture. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve and transfer to a large bowl. Repeat with the remaining sherry, vermouths, pisco, and zest. Add the syrup, bitters, and water to the mixture and stir to combine, then transfer to a 1-liter bottle. Seal and refrigerate until cold. Serve in chilled coupes (this recipe makes ten drinks), garnished with the Meyer lemon wheels.

      notes: One thing we love about the Daiquiri is that it's a phenomenal way to explore the diverse world of rum. For our root recipe, we veer slightly from the classic by using a split base of light Spanish-style rum accented with a tiny amount of flavorful rhum agricole. We also bump up the lime juice a touch for a brighter hit of citrus. This recipe yields a drink that's simultaneously deeply refreshing and pleasantly complex.

      notes: To extend the experiment even further, you can use a liqueur or even a fortified wine as the core. And indeed, some classic sours are made in just this way. The Amaretto Sour is a great example. Because it calls for a full 2 ounces of nutty, sweet amaretto, some adjustments to the other ingredients are needed; to keep the cocktail from being way too sweet, we decrease the amount of simple syrup.

      notes: Some drinks benefit from using a combination of lemon and lime juices: lemon for its mild flavor and lime for its brightness. For our take on the classic Pisco Sour, this is exactly what we do, as we've found that this cocktail isn't nearly as delicious when we use just one or the other. The pungency of the lime juice plays well with the gritty texture of the pisco, and the relative neutrality of lemon juice prevents the lime from taking over.
      ingredients: 
      - 2 ounces Campo de Encanto Grand and Noble pisco 
      - ½ ounce fresh lemon juice

      notes: Grapefruit juice has a delicious bitter-tart flavor that makes it one of our favorite alternatives to lemon and lime juice in cocktails. To get an idea of how grapefruit juice affects the balance of a drink, we'll break down the classic Hemingway Daiquiri. Because grapefruit juice isn't as acidic as lime juice, simply substituting 1 ounce of it for the lime juice in our root Daiquiri recipe would yield a thin cocktail. And as you can see, the recipe for this classic variation also contains a somewhat generous amount of lime juice. Then, because both the grapefruit juice and the maraschino liqueur add sweetness, the amount of simple syrup is dialed way back. This drink is very much about the relationship between rum, grapefruit juice, and maraschino liqueur, but it gets its amazing vibrancy from the lime juice and simple syrup.
      ingredients: 
      - 1½ ounces Flor de Caña 4-year white rum
      - ½ ounce Luxardo maraschino liqueur 
      - 1 ounce fresh grapefruit juice

      notes: Former Death & Co head bartender Brian Miller's reworked recipe set the stage for this version of our own. A tiki-head of unquenchable enthusiasm, Brian meticulously studied the Zombie form and built a delicious (and highly potent) cocktail (see our first book, "Death & Co: Modern Classic Cocktails" for the recipe). Our homage backs off slightly on the booze (only a little!) and tweaks the rum mix a bit. Depending on the availability of rum in your area, the key is to ensure the mix of a Jamaican rum, an aged Spanish style rum, and aged 151 rum (also known as firewater). Drink with caution.

      notes: In bartending circles, there's an ongoing debate about whether this classic Daiquiri variation should be made with lemon juice or lime juice. Frankly, it's delicious either way, but we lean toward lime for its brightness when combined with mint. The Southside is similar to our Fresh Gimlet but even more refreshing thanks to the muddled mint. It's also slightly more complex because it includes a dash of bitters.

      source: "Death & Co: Cocktail Codex"
      notes: The Daiquiri template is so simple that riffing on it is easy. One of our favorite starting points is to introduce another rum or spirit as part of the core. Here, we replace a bit of the rum with rich, smooth Cognac, then bolster the aged character of the Cognac with a spiced syrup. When choosing the citrus for this drink, it could be tempting to use lemon juice because it would complement the Cognac and cinnamon so well. The result would be a decent drink, but lime juice cuts through the cinnamon and Cognac and imparts an unexpected astringency, keeping the drink bright and refreshing.

      notes: The Boukman Daiquiri highlights an interesting way to play with the sour template - by substituting a flavorful syrup for the simple syrup. A good rule of thumb for matching flavorful syrups with citrus is that lemon juice has a soft acidity that doesn't distract from honey, whereas lime juice brings an astringency that can cut through a dense syrup or heighten the flavors in a syrup. If honey were paired with lime juice in this classic cocktail, its flavor would disappear into the background.

      notes: You can think of this classic cocktail as a mash-up between the Bee's Knees and the Jack Rose. Gin and a bit of apple brandy make up the core and are enhanced by juicy-tart grenadine. Lime juice would overpower the gin, whereas lemon acts as a soft bridge between the gin, brandy, and grenadine. The Pink Lady is also a good lesson in restraint; if it simply used a full ¾ ounce of grenadine in place of the simple syrup in the basic sour template, the cocktail would be all about the grenadine; instead, it calls for just ½ ounce of grenadine and supplements it with simple syrup. Why only ½ ounce of lemon juice? Grenadine also has some acidity, and combined with the drying effect of egg white, a full ¾ ounce of lemon juice would create a tongue-strippingly dry cocktail.
      ingredients: 
      - 1½ ounces Plymouth gin

      notes: In many cases, pairing an aged spirit like bourbon with lime juice yields results that are less than pleasant. Try making a Basic Sour with whiskey and lime juice, and you'll see what we mean; the same properties that make bourbon so tasty—vanilla, spice, tannins—don't play well with the high acidity, astringency, and flavor of lime juice. That's why recipes for cocktails like the classic Whiskey Sour generally call for lemon juice rather than lime.

      notes: In this cocktail, as in the Kentucky Maid, a bit of highly herbaceous mint helps bridge the gap between seemingly mismatched aged spirits and lime juice-a function also served by the absinthe in this recipe. Note that this cocktail and the Smokescreen (page 132) have exactly the same ingredients with the exception of the accent-absinthe in this case and Chartreuse in the Smokescreen. Even though only small amounts of these two accents are used, the end result is two very different flavor profiles, showing how something simple and seemingly minor can make a world of difference in a cocktail's flavor.

      notes: The Pompadour explores another way to riff on a Basic Sour: by incorporating a low-ABV ingredient as part of a split base, in this case, the French aperitif Pineau des Charentes. As you can see, the volume of the Pineau des Charentes is higher than if a boozy spirit were swapped into the split base.

Whereas the absinthe gives the Smoke and Mirrors an anise undertone that contrasts with the smoky scotch, the Chartreuse gives the Smokescreen a savory quality thanks to its grassy, tarragon-like flavor, which draws out the Laphroaig scotch's vegetal side.
      ingredients: 
      - 4 mint leaves
      - ¾ ounce simple syrup
      - 1 ounce Famous Grouse scotch
      - ½ ounce Laphroaig 10-year scotch
      - ¼ ounce green Chartreuse
      - ¾ ounce fresh lime juice 
      - Garnish: 1 mint sprig
      steps:
      - In a shaker, gently muddle the mint with the simple syrup. Add the remaining ingredients and shake with ice. Strain into a double Old-Fashioned glass over 1 large ice cube. Garnish with the mint sprig.

      notes: Despite the conventional wisdom that lemon juice is a better partner for aged spirits than lime juice, well-chosen ingredients can be used to bridge these kinds of conflicting elements, leading to delicious and surprising combinations. One of our favorite examples of this is the Kentucky Maid, concocted by the legendary barman Sam Ross. Here, bourbon and lime are bridged by muddled cucumber and mint, resulting in an unexpectedly refreshing cocktail. The cucumber adds juiciness similar to how lemon would, and the mint provides herbaceous seasoning. Without question, the Kentucky Maid is our go-to "welcome to bourbon" cocktail—we haven't met anyone who doesn't like it.
      ingredients: 
      - 5 mint leaves
      - 3 slices cucumber
      - ¾ ounce simple syrup 
      - 2 ounces Elijah Craig Small Batch bourbon
      - 1 ounce fresh lime juice
      - Garnish: 1 mint sprig skewered through 1 cucumber wheel
      steps:
      - Put the mint in a shaker and top with the cucumbers. Add the simple syrup and muddle, making sure to break up the cucumber skins. Add the bourbon and lime juice and shake with ice. Strain into a double Old-Fashioned glass over 1 large ice cube. Garnish with the mint sprig skewered through a cucumber wheel.

      notes: Riffing on the Hemingway Daiquiri is a great way to create new cocktails that are both exciting and refreshing. In the High Five, we use a very similar formula but substitute gin as the core. We also use Aperol to amplify the bitterness of the grapefruit, and because Aperol isn’t as sweet as the maraschino liqueur in the Hemingway Daiquiri, we add in a bit more simple syrup.
      ingredients: 
      - 1½ ounces Beefeater gin
      - ½ ounce Aperol
      - 1 ounce fresh grapefruit juice
      - ½ ounce fresh lime juice
      - ½ ounce simple syrup

      notes: When paired with robust aged spirits, grapefruit juice acts differently than it does when combined with lighter liquors. Whereas spirits like rum and gin enhance the refreshing flavor of grapefruit, aged spirits tend to draw out some of the denser flavors and sweetness in the juice. Though the classic recipe for a Brown Derby doesn't call for any citrus beyond the grapefruit juice, we like to add just a bit of lemon juice to cut through some of the richness of the syrup, which might otherwise overshadow the brightness of the grapefruit juice.
      ingredients: 
      - 2 ounces Elijah Craig Small Batch bourbon
      - 1 ounce fresh grapefruit juice 
      - 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice

    - name: Mojito
      author: 
      year: 
      source: "Death & Co: Cocktail Codex"
      notes: While the Mojito is certainly a member of the Daiquiri extended family, using similar proportions of the same ingredients-rum, lime juice, and sweetener-the fact that it's served over crushed ice makes it a distant cousin, at least in our eyes. Introducing crushed ice into the equation means it's necessary to think about how the cocktail will evolve after it's served. The key is to pack the ice into the glass, using a greater volume of ice than the volume of the cocktail. This will keep the cocktail cold and also keep the ice from moving around. Why should it matter if the ice moves around? If it does, dilution will occur more rapidly and the cocktail will quickly become a watery mess. To avoid this, we take a few precautions when building Mojitos and their variations. First, we use a glass that can hold both a full cocktail and an appropriate amount of ice. Either a Collins glass or a double Old-Fashioned glass that can hold at least 16 ounces will fit the bill. Second, we freeze the glass so it's extremely cold when the cocktail is poured in. Third, instead of shaking the drink, we use a technique called whipping: shaking the drink with a few pieces of crushed ice—just enough to mix the ingredients without diluting them too much. After all, there's no need to chill the cocktail as much as one served neat, since it's served over so much crushed ice, which will also serve the function of diluting the drink. Fourth and finally, after we pour the drink into the glass, we add crushed ice to fill the glass about four-fifths full, then stir or swizzle for a few seconds, and then pack the glass with ice, mounding the ice on top, like a snow cone. The end result should be a glass full of crushed ice, all the way to the bottom, with an even distribution of liquid, and a cone of crushed ice above the wash line.
      ingredients: 
      - 10 mint leaves
      - ¾ ounce simple syrup
      - 1 white sugar cube
      - 2 ounces Caña Brava white rum
      - 1 ounce fresh lime juice
      - Garnish: 1 mint bouquet
      steps:
      - In a shaker, gently muddle the mint leaves, simple syrup, and sugar cube until the sugar cube breaks apart. Add the remaining ingredients and whip, shaking with a few pieces of crushed ice, just until incorporated. Dump into a Collins glass and add crushed ice until the glass is about four-fifths full. Swizzle for a few seconds, then pack the glass with ice, mounding it above the rim. Garnish with the mint bouquet, placing it in the center of the ice and serve with a straw.

      notes: The Jack Frost is a Mojito variation with a split base of tequila, pear brandy, and dry vermouth, accented with a bit of crème de menthe. Although the finished cocktail isn't overly minty, there is a cooling quality to the liqueur, like inhaling cold air on a snowy winter night—an effect that's enhanced by the crushed ice.

      notes: Crushed ice can help temper the sweetness of rich ingredients. A classic Mai Tai is a complex combination of funky rums, almond-laced orgeat, orange liqueur, and lime juice. The result is a complex cocktail that can easily teeter toward being too sweet. Serving it in a glass packed with crushed ice lightens the flavors just the right amount while still allowing their complexity to come through.

      notes: Muddling is a great technique for drawing out the flavors from less acidic citrus fruits, such as mandarin oranges, which have intensely aromatic peels and sweet juice. In the Touch and Go, a cross between a tequila-based sour and a Caipirinha that's balanced even without muddled citrus, we include the mandarin orange to add a layer of vibrant flavor.
      ingredients: 
      - ½ mandarin orange, cut into 4 pieces
      - ¾ ounce Basil Stem Syrup
      - 1½ ounces Espolón blanco tequila

      notes: As discussed earlier in this chapter, citrus skins are loaded with flavorful oils. These can be expressed from twists, but they can also be incorporated via muddling. The Brazilian Caipirinha, which includes almost an entire lime, provides a great opportunity to consider the finer details of muddling citrus. When we cut lime wedges to garnish a drink, we do so in such a way that they're easy to squeeze into a cocktail, cutting them into wedges from the top to the bottom of the lime. But for muddling, we prefer to cut them into pieces of a size and shape that make it easy to extract both the juice and the oils in the skin with one even pressing. So first we cut the lime in half across the middle, then we place the halves on a cutting board cut side down and slice them into quarters. The lime is then muddled with sugar, which helps extract flavor from the lime skin. We prefer to use a sugar cube because it cuts into the lime skin to bring out more of its oils. We recommend putting the sugar cube in a small shaker tin, then adding the lime and simple syrup. Muddle each piece of lime by pressing down and twisting slightly to flatten the lime and break down the sugar. Stop muddling as soon as all of the pieces have been crushed. Although we're typically militant about never pouring the ice we shake a cocktail with into the serving glass, we make an exception for the Caipirinha, which is traditionally served with not just the ice, but also the muddled lime. This allows the lime to continue to flavor the cocktail—though they can get bitter, we find that it's a pleasant limey flavor that builds toward the end of the cocktail. The brightly colored citrus also looks beautiful in a glass.
      ingredients: 
      - 1 lime
      - ¾ ounce simple syrup 
      - 1 sugar cube
      - 2 ounces cachaça
      steps:
      - Cut the lime in half crosswise, then cut each half into quarters. Put 6 of the pieces in a shaker, reserving the other 2 for another use. Add the simple syrup and sugar cube and gently muddle the lime, carefully pressing each piece. Add the cachaça and shake with ice, then dump into a double Old Fashioned glass. No garnish.

      year: 
      source: "Death & Co: Cocktail Codex"
      notes: Another type of drink in the Daiquiri's extended family is sours that have bubbly ingredients added. This is such a broad category that it has several subfamilies: Collins-style drinks, fizzes, and numerous cocktails that include sparkling wine. We'll start with the Collins, which is basically a sour served in a tall glass with ice and seltzer. The biggest challenge in preparing a Collins is avoiding over-dilution. We like our Collinses as fizzy as possible, so rather than shaking them to full dilution, as for sours, we short shake them-just long enough to chill the ingredients without adding too much dilution, about five seconds. This leaves more room for the seltzer. Traditionally, Collins-style drinks are topped with seltzer that isn't stirred into the drink. We view this as less than ideal. When the drink is sipped through a straw, the experience is often like drinking a sour that gradually dilutes and may not be bubbly at all. Our preferred method is to add a measured portion of seltzer to the empty serving glass, then pour in the contents of the shaker, an action that effectively mixes the cocktail, and then add ice at the very end-no stirring required. To make the best Collins, use seltzer that's as cold as possible: keep it refrigerated and sealed before use or, better yet, build a carbonating rig and make your own very cold and highly sparkling seltzer (see page 232). Room temperature seltzer is a waste of time; the bubbles will escape quickly and the seltzer will become flat. Add this to a drink and you're really just diluting it.
      ingredients: 
      - 2 ounces cold seltzer
      - 2 ounces Beefeater gin
      - 1 ounce fresh lemon juice
      - ¾ ounce simple syrup
      - Garnish: 1 orange half wheel and 1 brandied cherry on a skewer
      steps:
      - Pour the seltzer into a Collins glass. Short shake the remaining ingredients with ice for about 5 seconds, then strain into the glass. Fill the glass with ice cubes and garnish with the orange half wheel and cherry.

      author: Sam Ross
      year: 2005
      source: "Death & Co: Cocktail Codex"
      notes: When experimenting with the Collins template, keep in mind that seltzer contains a bit of carbonic acid, which increases the perception of acidity. For this reason, we often use a 1-to-1 ratio of citrus juice to sweetener in Collins-style cocktails unless we want an extra-tart drink (which we do for the basic Collins, but when adding other flavors we tend to back off on the acid). In the Grapefruit Collins, the grapefruit juice has a balanced sweet tart flavor, so we remove it from the equation and then use equal amounts of lemon juice and simple syrup.
      ingredients: 
      - 2 ounces cold seltzer 
      - 2 ounces Beefeater gin
      - 1½ ounces fresh grapefruit juice 
      - ½ ounce fresh lemon juice
      - ½ ounce simple syrup 
      - 4 dashes Peychaud's bitters 
      - Garnish: 1 grapefruit half wheel

      notes: The Parachute is a great example of building a Collins-style cocktail on a low-proof base, here split between a juicy white port and the slightly bitter Salers aperitif. Because each of these ingredients has a powerful flavor, this cocktail drinks much like a full-proof sour but doesn't carry such a strong alcohol punch.

      notes: The Moscow Mule is famous for good reason: it has a strong ginger bite and is unquestionably refreshing. You may notice that this recipe uses slightly less lime juice than a typical sour-style cocktail. We do this to honor the original recipe, which was just a simple mixture of vodka and ginger beer topped with a squeeze of lime—more a Highball than a sour. In addition, ginger's powerful flavor has a zip somewhat like citrus, so when we use it, we often back down on any lemon or lime juice in the cocktail to let it shine.
      ingredients: 
      - 2 ounces cold seltzer
      - 2 ounces vodka
      - ½ ounce fresh lime juice
      - ¾ ounce House Ginger Syrup
      - Garnish: 1 lime wheel and 1 piece of candied ginger on a skewer

      notes: In the Moscow Mule, the vodka core keeps the cocktail clearly focused on the interplay between ginger, lime juice, and the fizziness of seltzer. If a more flavorful spirit is used, the proportion of ingredients may need to be adjusted-a principle that's clearly illustrated in our version of the Dark and Stormy (which, like the Moscow Mule, was traditionally made with ginger beer). To balance the rich molasses flavor of Gosling's Black Seal rum, we up the amounts of both the ginger syrup and the lime juice.
      ingredients:

      source: "Death & Co: Cocktail Codex"
      notes: At their simplest, fizzes are basically Collins-style drinks served without ice. Although fizzes are most commonly associated with gin, they can be made with any spirit. This classic cocktail, the Silver Fizz, is a simple fizz to which an egg white has been added. When the cocktail is shaken, the egg white's tightly packed proteins unfold and trap air, forming bubbles. When the drink is then topped with seltzer even more frothiness ensues, as those proteins wrap around the carbon dioxide bubbles to create a light and fluffy foam.
      ingredients: 
      - 2 ounces Beefeater gin
      - ¾ ounce simple syrup
      - ¾ ounce fresh lemon juice
      - 1 egg white
      - 2 ounces cold seltzer

Slowly add the seltzer, occasionally tapping the bottom of the glass on a table or flat surface to settle the foam. As you finish adding the seltzer, a white puck of foam should form on top of the drink. No garnish.

      notes: Perhaps the most famous of the fizzes is the Ramos Gin Fizz, a New Orleans cocktail wherein the clean simplicity of a Silver Fizz is enriched with heavy cream. Traditionally, it's shaken for a full ten minutes to create a light, ethereal texture that's like a boozy liquid cloud. We've never found a full ten-minute shake to be necessary (it's more theater than necessary); five minutes is more than enough to create the airy lightness needed for the Ramos. (See page 265 for the N₂O Ramos Gin Fizz, a version made in a whipper canister.)

      notes: The legendary bartender Audrey Saunders created this deeply complex cocktail that livens up a Mojito with bubbles. To add greater complexity, Audrey relies on a lightly aged rum and seasons with Angostura bitters and mint, creating a drink that is both refreshing and sophisticated. We love the Old Cuban because it evolves as you drink it: with the first sips, you're met with tongue-tingling effervescence and fresh mint flavors. As the cocktail warms and the bubbles lose a bit of their intensity, the rum's richness comes to the front in a soothing way.

      notes: Yes, Champagne does make everything better, including a Collins! Some bartenders prepare a French 75 in a tall glass with ice like a Collins, but we opt for the swankier version in a flute. Either way, introducing Champagne (or a similar style of sparkling wine) changes the cocktail's balance, adding both proof and flavor. Therefore, the formula for this classic cocktail calls for decreased amounts of all three elements of the sour base—in our version, half the gin, and two-thirds of the lemon juice and simple syrup.
      ingredients: 
      - 1 ounce Plymouth gin
      - ½ ounce fresh lemon juice

      notes: Beer and cider can also be used to add effervescence to Collins-style drinks. Because these ingredients can vary widely in alcohol content, flavor, sweetness, and acidity, using them requires careful attention to adjusting the amounts of the base spirit, citrus juice, and sweetener. In the Accidental Guru, just 1 ounce of strong spirit (whiskey) is used and the citrus juice is dialed back a bit. Less sweetener is also used, in this case because the drink is enhanced with peach liqueur.
      ingredients: 
      - 1 ounce Bushmills Original Irish whiskey
      - ½ ounce Giffard Crème de Pêche de Vigne
      - ½ ounce fresh lime juice

      - 3 ½ ounces cold Blanche de Bruxelles beer (or another wheat beer)
      - Garnish: 1 lime wheel
      steps:

      notes: What do you think? Sure, it may be tasty, but to us, it doesn't seem to be anything special. The Cognac is clearly the star of the show, but its woodsier notes are muted by the refreshing combination of lemon and sugar. Set that glass aside to reference in a few minutes and rinse your shaking tin. Then put together the following variation, which substitutes Cointreau for the simple syrup, yielding a basic Sidecar.
      ingredients: 
      - 2 ounces Cognac (preferably VSOP)
      - ¾ ounce fresh lemon juice
      - ¾ ounce simple syrup

      notes: What's the first thing you taste? We're guessing it's booze. This spec packs a hell of a punch, and though that's not necessarily a bad thing, alcohol dominates the flavor profile, creating a harsh, bitter drink. This is a widespread problem in cocktail making: ignoring the proof of higher ABV modifying ingredients, like Cointreau, and simply substituting them for a sweetener without adjusting the ratios. At 80 proof, Cointreau is just as boozy as most base spirits, and while its sweetness will curb some of the effects of the lemon juice, the resulting cocktail is far too dry. That's why the classic Sidecar recipe calls for less Cognac, along with slightly more Cointreau, to provide a bit more sweetness. So, even if you've already made the classic recipe at the beginning of the chapter, make it again so you can do a side-by-side comparison.
      ingredients: 
      - 2 ounces Cognac (preferably VSOP) 
      - ¾ ounce Cointreau
      - ¾ ounce fresh lemon juice

      notes: We find that this classic recipe achieves an almost perfect balance, with the full-bodied character of the Cognac being complemented by the bright sweetness of Cointreau and the refreshing quality of lemon juice. However, because this spec tends to be a bit dry for most people, our root recipe also includes a tiny amount of simple syrup to achieve an ideal balance and boost the flavors of the cocktail.

      notes: Between the Sheets is a good cocktail for exploring what specific bottles bring to a cocktail. Our house spec for this classic has a split base of youthful VS Cognac paired with the large personality of Jamaican rum, balanced by Pierre Ferrand's dry curaçao. If we had stuck with Cointreau, as in the classic Sidecar, we might not need any additional sweetener, but because the Pierre Ferrand is so dry, we include a bit of Demerara Gum Syrup to give the cocktail more body.

      - 1 ounce Paul Beau VS Cognac

      notes: Another instructive example of simple core substitution is the White Lady, an established riff on the Sidecar that plugs in gin for the Cognac. As with the Margarita, if the amounts of ingredients remain true to the Sidecar template, the gin would be overshadowed by the orange liqueur and have a punishing astringency. So to rebalance this classic cocktail, we increase the amount of gin to boost its personality, back off on the Cointreau, and add a bit of simple syrup. The White Lady also illustrates how egg white affects a cocktail and impacts the drinker's perception of balance. Though we cover the use of egg whites elsewhere (see pages 253 and 264), within the Sidecar family they can take on another dimension. Because the egg white's frothiness expands the drink's overall volume, it spreads the cocktail's flavor throughout that volume.
      ingredients: 
      - 2 ounces Plymouth gin
      - ½ ounce Cointreau 
      - ¾ ounce fresh lemon juice
      - ¼ ounce simple syrup

      notes: One of our favorite ways to show novice bartenders how to use pear brandy in a cocktail is by using it in a split base in a classic Sidecar. In this cocktail, it's paired with Paul Beau Cognac, chosen specifically for its textural earthiness, reminiscent of pear skin. A hint of cinnamon spice in the form of a syrup brings warmth that rounds off the sharp boozy edges.

      notes: Low-ABV cocktails are becoming more popular, for a variety of good reasons. For our part, we admit that we love being able to enjoy multiple drinks in a session without getting too tipsy, and the same is true for many of our guests. One approach to creating them is to split the core between a larger portion of fortified wine and a small measure of strong spirits. In a Sidecar, the strong spirit can then work with a flavorful liqueur to balance and season the drink. Note that because fortified wine often has some sweetness, it may be necessary to use a bit less liqueur.
      ingredients: 
      - 1 peach wedge
      - 1½ ounces Lillet rosé
      - ½ ounce Pierre Ferrand Ambre Cognac
      - 1 teaspoon Laphroaig 10-year scotch

      notes: Swap rich crème de cacao for the Cointreau—and a little Lillet blanc to stretch out the sweetness of the cacao—and you've got yourself the 20th Century, a chocolaty cocktail that doesn't taste like liquid dessert. (You'll notice that this cocktail calls for a full ½ ounces of gin-an adjustment that's necessary because crème de cacao is sweeter and lower in proof than Cointreau.) Thanks to the bright botanicals from the gin and the acidity from both the lemon juice and the Lillet blanc, the drink gives the impression of fruity cacao nibs, rather than a decadent chocolate bar.
      ingredients: 
      - 1½ ounces London dry gin

      notes: The classic Last Word uses intensely herbaceous green Chartreuse and funky maraschino liqueur in place of the Cointreau. The two liqueurs are front and center and bring a lot of proof to the cocktail, thereby requiring the gin be reduced in proportion. In this case, the green Chartreuse and maraschino are both the dominant flavor, bringing sweetness to the cocktail and balancing the acidity of the lime juice, while the gin helps dry the cocktail out.

      notes: All Carrie Bradshaw jokes aside, it's hard to hate the Cosmopolitan. A Cosmo is beautifully refreshing, and if ever there was a gateway drink that led people to explore other cocktails, this would be the one. It also provides a great demonstration of how an established template can quickly be transformed into an entirely new cocktail. The Cosmo is a Sidecar that swaps citrus vodka for the Cognac and lime juice for the lemon, with a small amount of cranberry juice added. Where this drink can and often does go wrong is in using cranberry cocktail and adding too much of it. This makes the whole thing a sweet mess, which may be tasty for people unaccustomed to strong spirits, but it robs the cocktail of complexity, sophistication, and balance. Though cranberry cocktail is the ingredient originally called for in Cosmopolitans, we encourage you to try a version made with pure, unsweetened cranberry juice. Admittedly, it is very tannic and behaves quite differently in cocktails, so for our version, we balance the cranberry juice with an equal amount of simple syrup, and then increase the amount of vodka slightly to help it punch through the tart sweetness.
      ingredients: 
      - 2 ounces citrus vodka 
      - ¾ ounce Cointreau

      notes: To make our ideal Cosmopolitan, we stick with high-quality ingredients and use clarified lime juice to mimic the clarity of what most folks know as a "Cosmo," minus the Rose's Lime Juice and crappy cranberry cocktail.

      notes: Highly potent bitters can also be added to a cocktail to help adjust the balance.

Gin acts in a supporting role to Cointreau's juicy flavor and sweetness, and so by adding a dash each of both Angostura and House Orange bitters, we are able to introduce seasoning that dries out the cocktail a bit while curbing the sharpness of the lime.

      notes: In the classic Champs-Élysées, green Chartreuse replaces the Cointreau in a Sidecar. Because Chartreuse is high proof (110% ABV) and intensely herbaceous, the formula must be adjusted accordingly. As you can see, the amount of liqueur is dialed back. In addition, the amount of Cognac is increased slightly, and simple syrup is added to help push the cocktail back into balance.

      notes: When a liqueur drives the flavor of the cocktail, this usually requires some changes to the citrus. In the Four to the Floor, a variation on the Corpse Reviver #2, the base is a beautiful marriage of pisco and grapefruit liqueur, so we opt to replace the more acidic citrus juice, which would overshadow those flavors, with verjus. Technique comes into play here, with the finished cocktail having a smooth, silky texture because it's stirred, whereas shaking would introduce air bubbles.

In this case, the classic recipe already includes ample richness in the core spirits and sweet peach liqueur, and the syrup bolsters those ingredients to increase the drink's body.
      ingredients: 
      - 2 ounces cold seltzer
      - ¾ ounce Pierre Ferrand Ambre Cognac
      - ¾ ounce Appleton Estate Reserve Blend rum
      - ¾ ounce Giffard Crème de Pêche de Vigne
      - ¾ ounce fresh lemon juice 
      - ¼ ounce Cane Sugar Syrup 
      - 1 strip lemon peel
      - Garnish: 1 lemon wheel and nutmeg
      steps:
      - Pour the seltzer into a Collins glass or goblet. Short shake the remaining ingredients with ice for about 5 seconds, then strain into the glass. Fill the glass with ice cubes, then garnish with the lemon wheel and grate some nutmeg over the top of the drink.

      notes: In the Chatham Cocktail, the core is a blend of fortified wines, which bring more sugar and acidity to the drink, and the drink is topped with Champagne, which brings even more acidity. Therefore, we use a smaller amount of both Grand Marnier and lemon juice and boost the amount of simple syrup.
      ingredients: 
      - ¾ ounce Cocchi Americano bianco 
      - ¾ ounce Lustau Puerto fino sherry 
      - ¼ ounce Grand Marnier 
      - ½ ounce fresh lemon juice 
      - ¼ ounce simple syrup 
      - Pinch of salt
      - 1½ ounces Champagne 
      - Garnish: 1 grapefruit twist
      steps:
      - Short shake all the ingredients (except the Champagne) with ice for about 5 seconds, then strain into a chilled flute. Pour in the Champagne, and quickly dip the barspoon into the glass to gently mix the Champagne with the cocktail. Express the grapefruit twist over the drink and then place it into the drink.

      notes: No exploration of the Sidecar's extended family would be complete without the infamous Long Island Iced Tea. Of course, a key way in which this cocktail diverges from the standard Sidecar recipe is in the amount of spirits, with the core containing a whopping 3 ounces of strong spirits, split between vodka, gin, tequila, and rum. The amounts of Cointreau and lemon juice, however, aren't increased, so the added cola contributes a burst of sugar and acidity to bring the whole thing into balance.
      ingredients: 
      - 2 ounces cold Coca-Cola
      - ¾ ounce Aylesbury Duck vodka
      - ¾ ounce Plymouth gin 
      - ¾ ounce Cimarrón blanco tequila
      - ¾ ounce Plantation 3 Stars rum
      - ¾ ounce Cointreau 
      - ¾ ounce fresh lemon juice
      - Garnish: 1 lemon wedge
      steps:

    - name: Americano
      author: 
      year: 
      source: "Death & Co: Cocktail Codex"
      notes: A staple aperitif cocktail, the Americano is like a Negroni (a member of the Martini family, page 89) in which the gin has been replaced with seltzer, transforming it into a Highball with a split base of Campari and sweet vermouth. Both ingredients are rich and bitter, even though they're lower in alcohol, which allows this basic Highball format to work without any modifications. That said, the orange garnish is important for this cocktail: it perfumes the nose, and its flavors slowly seep into the drink as it's consumed. We highly recommend having extra cold seltzer on hand to frequently top off an Americano, ideally in the late afternoon with a good book.
      ingredients: 
      - 1 ounce Campari
      - 1 ounce Carpano Antica Formula vermouth
      - 4 ounces cold seltzer

      notes: Though the Margarita may get the world's attention, Mexicans are far more likely to mix up a Paloma, which is simply grapefruit soda and tequila with a squeeze of lime. This cocktail can also be made with mezcal, and we highly recommend trying that variation. Our Paloma takes the traditional version and amplifies its flavors, first by making our own grapefruit soda from fresh grapefruit, and then adding a touch of grapefruit liqueur for even greater complexity.
      ingredients: 
      - Lime wedge
      - Kosher salt, for rimming
      - 1¾ ounces blanco tequila 
      - ¼ ounce Giffard Crème de Pamplemousse
      - ¼ ounce fresh lime juice 
      - 4 ounces cold Homemade Grapefruit Soda
      - Garnish: 1 grapefruit wedge
      steps:
      - Rub the lime wedge along the upper ½ inch of a Highball glass, halfway around the circumference, then roll the wet portion in the salt. Pour in the tequila, Pamplemousse, and lime juices, then add 3 ice cubes. Stir for 3 seconds. Add the soda and stir once. Garnish with the grapefruit wedge.

      author: 
      year: 
      source: "Death & Co: Cocktail Codex"
      notes: In the classic Cuba Libre, a humble Highball-rum and Coke-is elevated by adding a touch of lime juice. It's an inspired choice, because lime peel is a key ingredient in most colas, so the juice draws that flavor out of the cola while also cutting through its sweetness. The core spirit is also crucial to making this cocktail work: rum's sugarcane backbone complements the cola's round spice flavors, and whisky's spice can work wonderfully with cola's bitter and citrus flavors, but the subtlety of vodka would fall flat, and gin's botanicals would clash with the mixer.
      ingredients: 
      - 2 ounces white rum
      - ¼ ounce fresh lime juice
      - 4 ounces cold Coca-Cola
      - Garnish: 1 lime wedge

The delicious result is a classic Negroni Sbagliato. Because the sparkling wine has more flavor than seltzer, less is used, resulting in a cocktail that dances between bitter, sweet, and refreshing.

      - 1 ounce Carpano Antica Formula vermouth
      - 1 ounce Campari

      source: "Death & Co: Cocktail Codex"
      notes: As mentioned earlier, Screwdrivers (and similar Highballs that use citrus juice as the mixer) can be quite disappointing when made with processed commercial juices. However, these simple drinks can be redeemed by using freshly pressed juice from oranges that are in season. The juice itself is balanced, thanks to its bright acidity and sweetness, which makes for a refreshing cocktail. Even so, sometimes even fresh juice can fall a little flat. No problem! Just add a bit of Citric Acid Solution.
      ingredients: 
      - 4 ounces fresh orange juice 
      - Citric Acid Solution, if needed 
      - 2 ounces vodka
      steps:
      - Taste the juice before mixing. If the flavor seems a little flat, add a bit of Citric Acid Solution, a drop at a time, until the flavor is sweet with a tangy bite. Combine the orange juice and vodka in a Highball glass, then add 3 ice cubes. Stir for 3 seconds. No garnish.

      notes: Like the Screwdriver, the Tequila Sunrise is an oft-maligned classic cocktail that's greatly improved by using fresh, rather than commercial, juice. We also find the classic version a bit cloying because of the sweetness of the grenadine, so we compensate by adding just a bit of lime juice, which pairs well with the tequila. The result is a refreshing, juicy cocktail, perfect for daytime drinking.
      ingredients: 
      - 2 ounces blanco tequila
      - 4 ounces fresh orange juice
      - ¼ ounce fresh lime juice 
      - ¼ ounce House Grenadine

      steps:
      - Combine the tequila, orange juice, and lime juice in a Highball glass, then add 3 ice cubes. Stir for 3 seconds. Add the grenadine and don't stir so it will settle to the bottom of the glass. Garnish with the orange half wheel and lime wedge.

Tonic water isn't just a bitter seltzer; it also has a fair amount of sugar, giving it a sweetness that helps highlight the botanical flavors of high-proof English gin while curbing its alcohol heat.
      ingredients:

      - 4 ounces cold tonic water
      - Garnish: 1 lime wedge

      notes: Continuing our exploration of Highballs that have a bad reputation, consider the Harvey Wallbanger, basically a Screwdriver (page 213) with a float of Galliano on top—where just a small amount of liqueur adds flavor and complexity to a simple Highball. For our version of this classic, we pull back on the vodka a bit to compensate for the alcohol in the Galliano and, as with our take on the Tequila Sunrise (see left), we add a bit of citrus juice (in this case lemon) to compensate for the added sweetness. We also forgo floating the Galliano on top because we find that this creates an unbalanced cocktail, and the liqueur drops to the bottom anyhow.
      ingredients: 
      - 1½ ounces Aylesbury Duck vodka
      - ½ ounce Galliano l'Autentico 
      - 3 ounces fresh orange juice 
      - ½ ounce fresh lemon juice

      year: 2015
      source: "Death & Co: Cocktail Codex"
      notes: By now you know that we're big proponents of using fresh juices. But for years, we were confounded by tomato juice, since fresh versions have a thin flavor and tend to separate when mixed with booze. The answer, as it turns out, is to mix fresh tomato juice with a bit of bottled juice to stabilize the texture while still delivering fresh tomato flavor, so that's the approach we take in the Bloody Mary mix for this cocktail. Another pet peeve of ours is Bloody Marys with a grainy texture or particulates, such as spices or horseradish. So for this Bloody Mary mix, we forgo spices or horseradish and instead use a bit of fresh celery juice and bell pepper juice. With so much work dedicated to perfecting the mix, we chose savory aquavit to deepen the flavor even more. This mix is versatile, though: swap in vodka, gin, or even amontillado sherry.
      ingredients: 
      - Lemon wedge 
      - Lemon Pepper Salt (page 297) 
      - 1½ ounces Krogstad aquavit 
      - 5 ounces Normandie Club Bloody Mary Mix (page 296) 
      - ¼ ounce fresh lemon juice 
      - ¼ ounce fresh lime juice 
      - Garnish: 1 cherry tomato and 1 lemon wedge on a skewer
      steps:
      - Rub the lemon wedge along the upper ½ inch of a Collins glass, halfway around the circumference, then roll the wet portion in the Lemon Pepper Salt. Fill the glass with ice cubes. Add the remaining ingredients and stir a few times. Garnish with the cherry tomato and lemon wedge.

Use this recipe as a template and adjust the drink to suit your preferences. It's also a great canvas for experimentation. You could add a splash of mezcal for smoke, or substitute manzanilla sherry for the vodka to up the savory ante and bring the ABV down (you don't have to get drunk at brunch). Or consider making it with our Roasted Garlic- and Pepper-Infused Vodka (page 292).

      notes: Call us classicists, but we don't often veer away from the tomato-based Bloody Mary mixes used in the previous cocktails. One exception is our tomatillo-based Verde Mix, which is the perfect match for a spicy infused tequila. This drink needs more sugar than you'd think, as cucumber and tomatillo are naturally less sweet than tomatoes, so we add honey to the mix, which also adds a slight earthiness that helps unify the rest of the ingredients.

      notes: Nobody's Robots is a nerdy evolution of the Screwdriver made especially delicious by carbonating the entire cocktail. If you're equipped with a keg cocktail system (most people are, right?), this drink is a fantastic way to trick folks into drinking lots and lots of sherry. Overall, the flavors in this drink are more concentrated than those in a more typical Highball—a simple slug of booze topped with a mixer—which makes it feel more like a sophisticated cocktail.
      ingredients: 
      - 1 ounces Absolut vodka
      - 1 ounce Williams & Humbert Dry Sack sherry
      - 1 ounce clarified orange juice (see page 146)

      steps:
      - Chill all the ingredients. Combine them in a carbonating bottle, charge with CO2, and gently shake to help dissolve the CO2 into the liquid (see page 228 for detailed carbonation instructions). Refrigerate the carbonating bottle for at least 20 minutes, and preferably for 12 hours, before opening. Pour into an ice-filled Highball glass and garnish with the orange half wheel.

      source: "Death & Co: Cocktail Codex"
      notes: In chapter 1, we delved (all too briefly) into the world of sparkling wines (see page 28). Because they can vary so widely in levels of acidity and sugar and display flavors that range from sharp to rich and yeasty notes, they often aren't interchangeable in cocktails. As with the Screwdriver (page 213), there's no comparing a Mimosa made with freshly pressed, in-season orange juice to one made with pasteurized juice. The former is bright and refreshing, while the latter often tastes flat. That said, oranges do vary in sweetness and acidity, so we include a bit of Citric Acid Solution to ensure that the drink has a bright, zippy flavor.
      ingredients: 
      - 1 ounce fresh orange juice 
      - 3 drops Citric Acid Solution 
      - 5 ounces cold dry sparkling wine

      notes: Although Bellinis are served year round in bars around the world, they're at their best when made with peaches at the peak of their ripeness-a privilege that few get to experience. Even the highest-quality commercial peach puree will taste dull in comparison to one made with peaches in their prime. Take note of when peaches are available at your local farmers' market, then seize the opportunity to make this classic cocktail. That said, the beauty of the Bellini is that it can be made with almost any fresh, ripe fruit, opening the door to numerous new creations.

      author: 
      year: Another avenue for exploring Highball variations based on sparkling wines is to use fruit liqueur as a flavoring; just be careful not to add too much and oversweeten the drink. The classic Kir Royale strikes the right balance by using a restrained amount of crème de cassis, a black currant liqueur that retains the bright acidity of the fruit. That acidity makes it versatile for mixing, since it contributes both sweetness and sourness alongside its juicy fruit flavor. Although Champagne is traditional in this drink, Crémant de Bourgogne would also work well, and don't hesitate to venture farther afield, exploring the countless possibilities for pairing liqueurs with sparkling wines.

      notes: The classic Aperol Spritz sits alongside the Americano as an indispensable aperitif cocktail-a drink consumed before a meal to stimulate the app etite. While we stand by our belief that sparkling wine makes everything better, too much can overpower delicate flavors. This drink, made with Aperol, the lightest of aperitifs, is a case in point. If it were to call for more sparkling wine, that would push it into boozy territory, so it also includes seltzer to ensure that it's refreshing and fizzy enough, without overly interfering with the flavor profile.

      notes: The Daisy Chain takes an approach similar to the Normandie Club Spritz #3 to produce a cocktail that mimics the flavors of a glass of sparkling wine. The combination of bone-dry, salty manzanilla sherry, sweet and floral St-Germain, and juicy verjus could almost trick you into thinking you’re drinking a dry Muscat. Bitter Suze is added to curb the candy notes and the St-Germain and add an aperitif quality, while the sparkling cider brings body and funk—qualities not found in seltzer or sparkling wine.
      ingredients: 
      - 1½ ounces manzanilla sherry
      - ½ ounce St-Germain
      - ¼ ounce Suze
      - ½ ounce Fusion Napa Valley verjus blanc
      - ¼ ounce fresh lemon juice
      - 2 drops Salt Solution
      - 3 ounces Normandy sparkling apple cider
      - Garnish: 5 thin apple slices on a skewer
      steps:
      - Combine all the ingredients (except the cider) in a wine glass. Fill the glass with ice cubes and stir until chilled. Top with the cider and stir gently to combine. Garnish with the apple slices.

      notes: We took our Improved Wine Spritz and expanded on the idea to come up with the Normandie Club Spritz #3, which has a split base of dry vermouth and St-Germain, accompanied by clarified juices to provide balance without altering the Champagne-like texture of the cocktail. We also chose to fully carbonate the cocktail, rather than simply pouring in seltzer. This infuses the drink with a uniform effervescence that makes it incredibly quaffable.
      ingredients: 
      - 1 ounce Boissiere dry vermouth
      - 1 ounce St-Germain
      - ¼ ounce Pueblo Viejo blanco tequila
      - ¼ ounce Campo de Encanto Grand and Noble Pisco
      - ¼ ounce Giffard Crème de Pamplemousse
      - 1 ounce clarified grapefruit juice
      - ½ ounce clarified lemon juice
      - 2½ ounces cold seltzer
      - Garnish: 1 grapefruit half wheel
      steps:
      - Chill all the ingredients. Combine in a carbonating bottle, charge with CO2, and gently shake to help dissolve the CO2 into the liquid (see page 228 for detailed carbonation instructions). Refrigerate the carbonating bottle for at least 20 minutes, and preferably for 12 hours, before opening. Pour into an ice-filled Highball glass and garnish with the grapefruit half wheel.

      notes: Our Improved Wine Spritz demonstrates how we can integrate some of the principles from chapter 3, on Daiquiris and sours, to yield a superior Wine Spritz (see right) without veering too far from a Highball template. All we've done is add small amounts of lemon juice and simple syrup, but this brings an appealing sweet-sour balance to the drink, lifts the flavors of the wine, and gives the cocktail more body.
      ingredients: 
      - 4 ounces cold, crisp white or rosé wine
      - ¼ ounce fresh lemon juice 
      - ¼ ounce simple syrup 
      - 2 ounces cold seltzer
      - Garnish: 1 lemon wheel
      steps:
      - Combine the wine, lemon juice, and simple syrup in a wine glass. Fill the glass with ice cubes, pour in the seltzer, and stir gently to combine. Garnish with the lemon wheel.

      notes: You can also use still wine as the core of a drink. Because its proof is so much lower and the flavor more mild than a spirit, the amount of wine should be increased, with the amount of seltzer being decreased accordingly. Voilà! The classic Wine Spritz, which is indeed a type of Highball. Though wines vary widely in their sweetness and acidity, sticking with a small measure of seltzer as the mixer generally works well, as it will stretch and carry the distinctive flavors of the wine. We love a Wine Spritz with no trace of shame. What's not to like about a glass of chilled wine topped with seltzer? It's a drink fit for moms and cocktail nerds alike.
      ingredients: 
      - 4 ounces cold, crisp white or rosé wine
      - 2 ounces cold seltzer
      - Garnish: 1 lemon wheel

      - Pour the wine into a wine glass. Fill the glass with ice cubes, then pour in the seltzer and stir once. Garnish with the lemon wheel.

      source: "Death & Co: Cocktail Codex"
      notes: In terms of its ingredients, the King's Landing may seem like a fairly typical sour-style cocktail, if a little lean in the sour department. But if you take a close look at the amounts called for, you'll see that cava and our birch infused vermouth make up most of the volume of the cocktail, with relatively small amounts of lemon juice and pear liqueur being added for balance, keeping this cocktail firmly in Highball territory.
      ingredients: 
      - 1½ ounces Birch-Infused Cocchi Vermouth di Torino (page 287)
      - ½ ounce Clear Creek pear liqueur
      - ¼ ounce fresh lemon juice 
      - 3½ ounces cold cava
      - Garnish: 1 lemon wheel
      steps:
      - Combine the infused vermouth, pear liqueur, and lemon juice in a wine glass. Fill the glass with ice cubes, then pour in the cava and quickly dip the barspoon into the glass to gently mix the wine with the cocktail. Garnish with the lemon wheel.

      source: "Death & Co: Cocktail Codex"
      notes: Our favorite version of the Flip is one made with sherry because of the wine's nutty aroma and raisiny finish. Another popular variation is the classic Brandy Flip. For our ideal version of this drink, we first fine-tune the core, choosing the woodsy juiciness of Cognac, which works well with the fattiness of the egg. Then, although some recipes for this drink do call for a full 2 ounces of brandy, we think the brandy's higher proof calls for dialing back on the spirits a bit: too much alcohol in a Flip and it just tastes like creamy hooch. Finally, we increase the amount of sweetener slightly to compensate for the oloroso sherry's missing sweetness.
      ingredients: 
      - 1½ ounces Cognac
      - ¾ ounce Demerara Gum Syrup 
      - 1 whole egg

      notes: According to Jerry Thomas's 1887 Bar-Tender's Guide, this cocktail's name has nothing to do with its flavor (where's the coffee, after all?), but rather its appearance: it looks like a cup of coffee. Lucky for us, cocktail naming has come a long way in the past 150 years. Regardless, the drink is a great example of how the Flip's core can be split between a fortified wine and a spirit, marrying both the root, sherry-based Flip and the Brandy Flip above. Here, tawny port brings both a great deal of flavor and sweetness requiring less syrup to balance-while the Cognac supports it with woodsy complexity.
      ingredients: 
      - 1½ ounces tawny port
      - 1 ounce Pierre Ferrand Ambre Cognac
      - ¼ ounce simple syrup
      - 1 whole egg

      notes: Dairy is a natural companion to the richness of an egg. Either can contribute to the texture of a cocktail in a dramatic way, and when they're combined the effect is amplified. Of course, Eggnog is the classic example. Though it's typically made in large batches that involve a lot of work-preparing a custard base and then spiking it (as in the Tom and Jerry, on page 268)—that isn't always convenient, so we've come up with this single-serving version of Eggnog that can be made quickly and without much prep.
      ingredients: 
      - ¾ ounce Plantation Barbados 5-year rum
      - ¾ ounce Pierre Ferrand Ambre Cognac

      source: "Death & Co: Cocktail Codex"
      notes: One way to experiment with the balance in Flip-style drinks is to omit the egg and rely solely on the richness of cream. In fact, this style of cocktail is even more common and varied than egg-based drinks. Perhaps the most famous of these is the Alexander, which itself has many variations based on different core spirits. Our favorite is the classic Brandy Alexander, a mixture of brandy, crème de cacao, and heavy cream, where a rich liqueur serves as the sweetener. As in our take on the Brandy Flip (page 252), we favor a rich Cognac in this drink. Note that because the cocktail has a slightly higher alcohol content, it must be shaken a bit longer so it will be diluted enough to fill a standard coupe.
      ingredients: 
      - 1½ ounces Pierre Ferrand Ambre Cognac
      - 1 ounce Giffard white crème de cacao
      - 1 ounce heavy cream 
      - Garnish: Nutmeg

      notes: Eggnog and other nogs have inspired a whole host of cocktails that incorporate both egg and cream. Some of these variations are called Flips, including the classic New York Flip, which takes inspiration from another classic: the New York Sour, a sour-style cocktail made with bourbon, lemon juice, and simple syrup, shaken and served in a coupe with a float of juicy red wine. The New York Flip is a more decadent articulation that replaces the lemon juice with heavy cream and an egg yolk: the same idea of a New York Sour expressed as a Flip with the bourbon and port as the connecting ingredients.
      ingredients: 
      - 1 ounce Elijah Craig Small Batch bourbon 
      - ¾ ounce tawny port
      - ¼ ounce simple syrup

      notes: Some variations on the Flip template are simple concoctions that omit the egg, contain just a few ingredients, and are simply built in the serving glass. The classic White Russian is just such a drink. Because there's nothing complicated about these drinks, the quality of their ingredients is paramount. Like many other classic drinks in this chapter, the White Russian is often derided, but it's actually more carefully balanced than its reputation suggests. The fact that it calls for half-and-half, rather than cream, makes it light enough for everyday drinking; plus, if it called for heavy cream, the coffee flavor of the liqueur could be overwhelmed.
      ingredients: 
      - 1½ ounces Absolut Elyx vodka 
      - 1 ounce Caffé Lolita coffee liqueur 
      - 1 ounce half-and-half 
      - Garnish: 3 coffee beans

      notes: In this Flip variation, the cream isn't mixed into the cocktail; instead, it's whipped and floated on top. Because the heat of the underlying ingredients unravels the structure of the whipped cream, causing it to seep into the liquid in a less-than-appealing way, we recommend whipping the cream until it develops soft peaks so it will hold up longer.
      ingredients: 
      - 2 ounces heavy cream
      - 1½ ounces Jameson Irish whiskey
      - ¾ ounce Demerara Gum Syrup 
      - 3 ounces hot brewed coffee
      steps:
      - Using a bowl and whisk, whip the cream until soft peaks begin to form. Warm a coffee or toddy mug by filling it with boiling water, letting it sit a minute or two, then dumping out the water. Pour in the whiskey and syrup, then slowly add the coffee while stirring continuously. Carefully spoon all the whipped cream on top of the drink.

      notes: Long before central heat could protect us against the elements, humans had the bright idea to mix dairy with some booze to ward off the cold and rain. In fact, that may be how the Flip originated, as a heated mixture of egg, ale, and sugar. Although modern-day Flips are almost always served cold, the idea of a warm drink on a cold day remains appealing, and one of the most comforting warm drinks out there is the Tom and Jerry, a wintertime favorite packed with rum, Cognac, dairy, and eggs (which are a component of the Tom and Jerry Batter).
      ingredients: 
      - 1 ounce El Dorado 12-year rum
      - 1 ounce Pierre Ferrand Ambre Cognac

The Mudslide probably got its poor reputation because of how it's usually made: a near-equal mix of coffee liqueur, vodka, and Bailey's Irish cream. While that's okay, we prefer this version made with ice cream, a rich and flavorful addition that precludes the need to shake with ice, which can quickly water down the drink.

      source: "Death & Co: Cocktail Codex"
      notes: One of our favorite layered White Russian variations is the Hans Gruber, a cocktail that we created for a holiday-themed menu at the Walker Inn in 2015. In it, we've manipulated every component of the classic White Russian to create a sophisticated cocktail with the flavorful profile of pecan pie with ice cream. Though decadent, the toasted nuttiness of the pecan-infused rum and the implicit richness of the brown butter-infused brandy are balanced by the fig bomb of the Pedro Ximénez sherry. The maple-flavored whipped cream is one of our favorite revelations, with just a small amount of maple syrup flavoring the cream in a delicious way. We've also played with flavoring whipped cream with other ingredients, including orange curaçao and dry sherry. If you do the same, just be mindful of how much alcohol you add to the cream; anything more than around 2 ounce of alcohol per cup of cream will make the cream harder to whip.
      ingredients: 
      - 2 ounces heavy cream
      - ¼ ounce dark, robust maple syrup
      - 1 ounce Toasted Pecan-Infused Plantation Rum
      - ¾ ounce Brown Butter-Infused Apple Brandy
      - 1 ounce Lustau San Emilio Pedro Ximénez sherry
      - 1 teaspoon Giffard Vanille de Madagascar
      - ¼ ounce Cane Sugar Syrup
      - 3 drops Salt Solution 
      - Garnish: 1 spritz of Cruzan Black Strap rum
      steps:
      - Using a bowl and whisk, whip the cream and maple syrup together just until soft peaks start to form. In a mixing glass, stir the remaining ingredients with ice. Strain into a chilled coupe. Carefully spoon the whipped cream on top, then mist the blackstrap rum over the drink.

      author: Alex Day

      source: "Death & Co: Cocktail Codex"
      notes: The Campfire Flip is a smoky riff on a classic Flip. We start with a smoked ingredient, Hickory-Smoked Cognac, which we pair with sherry and a bit of vanilla liqueur. The result is a rich drink with a smoked-woody complexity that plays off the barrel-aged flavors already present in both the Cognac and the sherry.
      ingredients: 
      - 1 ounce Hickory Smoke-Infused Cognac (page 290)
      - 1 ounce Lustau Los Arcos amontillado sherry
      - 1 teaspoon Giffard Vanilla de Madagascar
      - ½ ounce Demerara Gum Syrup 
      - 1 whole egg
      - Garnish: Cinnamon and nutmeg
      steps:
      - Dry shake all the ingredients, then shake again with ice. Double strain into a chilled coupe. Garnish with a few grates of cinnamon and nutmeg.

    - name: Smoky Colada
      author: Alex Day
      year: 2017
      source: "Death & Co: Cocktail Codex"
      notes: Smoky flavors need not be introduced via smoke itself; they can also be added by including ingredients that have smoky flavors conferred by cooking, such as grilling. One of our favorite ways of working with this in cocktails is to use a syrup made with grilled pineapple, as in this smoky variation on the Piña Colada. Substituting our Grilled Pineapple Syrup for some of the fresh pineapple juice takes this rich tropical drink in a slightly savory direction.
      ingredients: 
      - 2 ounces Caña Brava white rum
      - ½ ounce Cruzan Black Strap rum 
      - ¾ ounce fresh pineapple juice
      - ¾ ounce Grilled Pineapple Syrup
      - 1 ounce House Coconut Cream
      - Garnish: 1 pineapple wedge and 1 brandied cherry on an umbrella skewer
      steps:
      - Combine all the ingredients in a shaker and whip, shaking with a few pieces of crushed ice, just until incorporated, then dump into a double Old-Fashioned glass and fill the glass with crushed ice. Garnish with the pineapple wedge and cherry and serve with a straw.

      notes: Apricots are such a frustrating fresh fruit to work with because they’re so inconsistent. You can buy a dozen of them and have two that are perfect beyond belief, three that are almost delicious, and seven others that are a mealy bunch of nothing. That’s why I use a good apricot liqueur in this drink instead of fresh fruit. I was after a light-bodied cocktail that shone forth with fruit and nuts yet remained dry and refreshing.—JS

      ingredients:
      - 1 teaspoon simple syrup
      - 1 teaspoon Luxardo Maraschino liqueur
      - 2 lemon twists
      - 1 strawberry
      - 1 white sugar cube
      - 1½ ounces Siembra Azul Blanco Tequila
      - ½ ounce Jalapeño–Infused Siembra Azul Blanco Tequila
      - ½ ounce Lustau East India Solera Sherry 
      - Garnish: ½ strawberry
      steps:
      - In a shaker, muddle the simple syrup, Maraschino liqueur, lemon twists, strawberry, and sugar cube. Add the tequilas and sherry and whip (shake with a few pieces of crushed ice, just until the ingredients are incorporated). Dump into a double rocks glass and top with crushed ice. Garnish with the half strawberry and serve with a straw.

      notes: The combination of cherries and Cynar was an exciting revelation for me. I love the way the muddled cherries look scattered on top of the crushed ice; I refer to this as “serving it messy.”—PW

      - 1 white sugar cube
      - 2 ounces Siete Leguas Blanco Tequila
      - ½ ounce Cynar

The problem was that he likes a lot of weird shit. But I gave it a shot, splitting both the base spirit and its modifiers, and it resulted in a surprisingly balanced drink.—PW

      - ¼ ounce Campari
      - ¼ ounce Grand Marnier

      notes: I didn’t think this drink would be as popular as it is, but when St-Germain is involved, you never know. I cut the calvados with a bit of Laird’s because otherwise it would taste too sweet; Laird’s is good for drying drinks out.—BM
      ingredients:
      - 2 ounces Busnel VSOP Calvados
      - ¼ ounce Laird’s Bonded Apple Brandy
      - ¾ ounce Carpano Antica Formula Vermouth

      - 2 dashes House Peychaud’s Bitters 
      - Garnish: 1 lemon twist
      steps:
      - Stir all the ingredients over ice, then strain into a coupe. Garnish with the lemon twist.

      notes: This cocktail is inspired by a vintage british drink called the treacle, which is a rum Old-Fashioned topped with a layer of apple juice. The black strap rum float in my version is almost like topping the drink with pancake syrup. First you smell the rum’s massive molasses aromas, then the acidic Pineau des Charentes, an aperitif made with grape must and cognac, cuts right through it.—TB
      ingredients:
      - 2 ounces Pasquet Pineau des Charentes
      - ½ ounce Cruzan Single-Barrel Rum

Stir with a teaspoon, churning the ice as you go, for about 10 seconds, holding the tin by the rim so the entire tin can eventually frost up. Add more crushed ice to fill the tin two-thirds full and stir until the tin is completely frosted. Add more ice to form a cone above the rim.

      notes: This started as a spin on our house gimlet, but then it took a sharp left turn. It’s a confusing drink. Arrack is a funky, weird ingredient that a lot of people don’t like.

      notes: About a quarter of our guests ask us to make them something spicy. Our first reaction is always to reach for a bottle of jalapeño-infused tequila, but I wanted to try something else to expand our spicy offerings.

      notes: One of our servers asked me to make her something stirred and boozy. So I threw four of my favorite spirits into an Old-Fashioned template, splitting the base four ways. All these brown spirits needed something to tie them together. Avery glasser (of the bitters company bittermens) happened to be sitting at the bar, and he suggested trying his mole bitters. It was like lacing up a shoe.—BM
